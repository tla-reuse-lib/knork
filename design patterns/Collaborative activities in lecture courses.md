**1. The educational problem**

Many university courses are conducted as conventional lecture-based courses because of practical reasons. For example, courses might be short and there is not enough time to organize proper collaborative processes, there are too many participants to effectively organize group work, or the teachers feel that they do not manage more challenging collaborative working methods well enough in order to implement them in their own courses.

**2. The solution**

*Therefore*, it is useful to offer also examples and models about how to embed less challenging and less time consuming collaborative knowledge creation activities in a lecture course. Even small-scale collaborative knowledge creation activities can make a difference in the participantsâ€™ learning experience. One activity, used in a seven week long lecture course in philosophy, was to add a tasks at the end of the course, where the participants gave oral and written feedback to the essays of their peer students in the groups of three, and the participants had a possibility to revise their essays after that, making use of the peer feedback before submitting the final version. The activity was much appreciated by the students of the course.

**3. The context**

These kind of small-scale collaboration activities can be implemented quite easily in any types of courses, also in courses with many participants and mass lectures.
