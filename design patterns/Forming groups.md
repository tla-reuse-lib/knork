**1. The educational problem**

Course participants may feel that it is challenging to change the composition of the groups that they have become used to working in. Teachers, on the other hand, may not be aware of how groups have been composed in earlier courses or modules and also intentionally encourage course participants to getting used to forming and establishing work practices in new groups. And in general, the view of collaboration and group work can be very different among people.

**2. The solution**

*Therefore*, provide recommendations at the beginning of the course on how to create a well functioning group.

**3. The context**

Courses where course participants are required to work on tasks collaboratively with others such as peers and supervisors.
