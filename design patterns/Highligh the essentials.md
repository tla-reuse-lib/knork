**1. The educational problem**

This pattern concerns problems related to learners who are overwhelmed in a new domain and in need of structure that makes explicit the most important concepts of a domain as a start for developing new knowledge practices. This pattern was originally developed in the context of simulation-based training of teams in healthcare but can probably be useful in many contexts where a group of learners are introduced to a new conceptual framework.

-   Learners may be overwhelmed by the complexity of a new domain.

-   Course participants may lack knowledge about and fail to see the importance of essential activities like making analyses.

-   Course participants do not expect to learn to make such analyses.

-   Participants may have wrong expectations about expertise; a common misconception is that experienced practitioners master teamwork and leadership skills, and that skills are implicitly picked up through experience.

-   Other problems concern the design or presentation of the essential concepts; if a model is too complex it risks not being learned, used and remembered.

**2. The solution**

*Therefore*, provide a simple model making explicit the most important concepts and tasks to support learners to start developing new knowledge practices. Base the model on other well-known models to support learning.

**3. The context**

Use when structure is important and when focus and precision in analyses are desired but when there is limited time to study more complex models, or if a goal is to develop a shared understanding or coherence in the teamâ€™s views. Beware of the risk of over-simplification if a model is taken as the final truth.
