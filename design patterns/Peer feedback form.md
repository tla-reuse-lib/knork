**1. The educational problem**

One of the design principles behind the Trialogical Approach is the upgradeability of ideas in the process of advancement of knowledge in a community. Yet, this is a process â€“ before than a goal - not so easy to realize, since it requires specific experience and capability.

**2. The solution**

*Therefore*, we decided to create a form that could help each group to analyze and comment on the scenarios of two other groups. After visioning the assigned scenarios, each group has to underline both the positive aspects and those - in their view - in need of a change, in order to make them clearer, more workable and more responsive to the initial request: to produce scenarios based on the theoretical knowledge acquired in the course and including the technology tools. The form focused on different dimensions (to which the group had to provide open and articulated comments): the accuracy of the general structure, good planning and evaluation of collaborative moments, the adequacy of the specified instruments and the target chosen, the recognition of an effective and real added value from the technologies, the presence of a constructivist teaching and the overall feasibility of the scenario. In addition, to promote critical competences and self-criticism, groups had to explain which aspects of the scenario they would have imported in their own, and which they would have exported.

**3. The context**

The form described above could be used in any course including the collaborative construction of pedagogical scenarios / educational projects, in order to allow the collection of useful feedback for a more finished project and to enable a peer-evaluation process.

The form was created through the Google Drive document tool. To allow groups to collect more feedback possible without triggering captatio benevolentiae mechanisms, it was decided to have each project reviewed from two groups and avoiding that the group reviewing the project X were then reviewed by the authors of the project X.

Each group discussed projects for review in the classroom and online, than they filled the form for the assigned groups. Reading the revisions received allowed all groups to improve some aspects of their project, without being forced to accept the proposed change if, after careful group-discussion, they concluded that they did not serve to improve their product.

We believe that this review model and feedback can be adopted in all kinds of courses and at different levels of training, adapting it to the demands of the project content. You can then choose from an online administration through Google Drive modules, or through a written compilation of the paper form, always encouraging sharing and group reflection of the comments to give.
