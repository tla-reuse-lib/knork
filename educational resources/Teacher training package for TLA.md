**Description of the resource**

*The online teacher training package* is meant as support material for teacher trainers in carrying out national and international teacher training workshops about *knowledge creation pedagogy and the Trialogical approach to learning*. The approach combines advanced pedagogical practices and modern digital tools for collaborative knowledge creation.

The package includes an example scenario for organizing teacher training, including recommendations for trainers about activities, videotaped expert lectures, presentation material, guidelines to be used in the course assignments, suggestions and examples about technology use, and working templates for the participantsâ€™ course planning, etc.

All sections of the package include two parts: 1) instructions for the trainers conducting the teacher training, and 2) example content to be used when creating the working spaces for the participants of the training. In the trainer part, all materials are in editable format (.ppt, .doc etc.), in the example content part they are in .pdf format, if the trainer wants to use them as such in the training.

The *Online teacher training package for Trialogical learning* is built using the *Open* e*dX platform* (in the server of Metropolia UAS). You can view the package in the following way:

-   First you have to have a user account in the *Open edX of Metropolia*. If you do not have one, go to [*http://edx.mw.metropolia.fi/*](http://edx.mw.metropolia.fi/), press *REGISTER NOW* and create a new account. After confirming the account, *Sign in* to the *Open edX Metropolia*.

-   After logging in the *edX*, go to the web address [*http://edx.mw.metropolia.fi/courses/knork/ottp02/2015/about*](http://edx.mw.metropolia.fi/courses/knork/ottp02/2015/about) and press the *Register*-button, after which you can view the course content.

You can duplicate the existing *Online Teacher Training Package* as a new copy for yourself by doing the following steps:

-   Log in (*Sign in*) to the *edX Studio Metropolia: [*http://studio.edx.mw.metropolia.fi/*](http://studio.edx.mw.metropolia.fi/)* using the same user account (you can also use another edX server but you need another user account there)

-   Create a new course.

-   Save the zip-version of the package ([*http://knork.info/website/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/OTTP\_v4\_2016-04-18.KNORK\_.tar.gz*](http://knork.info/website/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/OTTP_v4_2016-04-18.KNORK_.tar.gz)) in your computer and then import it into the new course (*Tools -&gt; Import*).

**The context**

The material can be used by preservice and inservice teacher trainers in secondary and tertiary education for designing and conducting teacher training about the Trialogical Learning Approach. The trainer can copy the package as a new EdX course and revise it there (delete trainer instructions and modify example contents for the training), or use individual materials, instructions and ideas in some other way and using other platforms. Of course it is also possible that individual teachers or lecturers study the content individually with the material, but it is not the primary purpose of the package.
