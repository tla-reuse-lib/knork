**1. The educational problem**

Taking part in a course such as a degree course, requires project planning, e.g. having a schedule for when different activities need to be carried out.

The view of collaboration and supervision can be very different among people.

Supervisors are not always fully prepared for or have experiences of the supervisor task. Moreover, supervisors are not always aware of all course activities which will to a high degree affect the work of course participants. Especially supervisors who are not teachers of a course and recruited from other contexts may not be as engaged and well-informed about the different modules and activities of a course. Not adapting supervision to course activities including the timing of feedback may disturb and delay the studentsâ€™ work. For instance, receiving feedback too late or even after required submission dates will not be helpful for course participants.

**2. The solution**

*Therefore*, encourage supervisors and course participants to collaboratively create shared calendars for supervision activities and to plan them in relation to project activities of the course.

**3. The context**

Courses which involve interaction between course participants and supervisors over time, especially supervisors who are external to the course.
