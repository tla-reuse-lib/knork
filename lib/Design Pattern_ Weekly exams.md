**1. The educational problem**

On a 15 ECTS course where students are studying only the single course, the exam at the end covering the full content of the course may become really wide. Having a single exam at the end of the course also puts heavy requirements for students skills in concentrating on studies while the course is running as it may prove out to be impossible to learn everything the night before the final exam.

**2. The solution**

*Therefore*, we came up with the approach of having a smaller test each week and a comprehensive test at the end of the course. The weekly test should be short (3-5 smallish questions) so that it could be completed in 30 minutes or less. Keeping the exam short also keeps the time required to checking the answers bearable.

**3. The context**

The approach works well if the single course comprises all or at least more than half of students work load. It would not work, if students have multiple courses each having weekly exams.
