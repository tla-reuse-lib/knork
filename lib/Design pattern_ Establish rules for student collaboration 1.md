**1. The educational problem**

Not all students are equally active in student groups which may cause friction and conflict. Some students may be more inclined to or used to engaging in collaborative work. Tight schedules and absences may add to friction and meeting virtually may make it more difficult than when meeting face to face to handle issues about when collaboration is not satisfactory.

**2. The solution**

*Therefore*, encourage student groups to define roles and divide work in the beginning of the course paying attention to the different backgrounds of the participating students. Suggest that work is commented on and revised before actual deadlines by setting up deadlines, which allow one day for evaluation and one day for improvements. Plan for regular meetings (face to face and virtually) where each member contributes. Plan for carrying out revisions together.

**3. The context**

Student groups collaborating on tasks with tight schedules and where the contribution of each member is important, especially when student groups may varied including students with different (study or other) backgrounds.
