**1. The educational problem**

Not all students are equally active in student groups. Some students are more engaging in collaborative work, than others. Some members of a team are lazy and rely on othersâ€™ work.

**2. The solution**

*Therefore*, encourage student groups to define roles and divide work between participating students in the beginning of the course and change these roles during the course. Suggest that work is commented on and revised before actual deadlines by setting up deadlines, which allow one day for evaluation and one day for improvements. Plan for regular meetings (face to face and virtually) where each member contributes.

**3. The context**

Student groups collaborating on tasks with tight schedules and where the contribution of each member is important, especially when student groups may varied including students with different motivation to study.
