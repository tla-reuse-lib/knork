**1. The educational problem**

Google Drive offers the opportunity to create and edit documents collaboratively. Once the students discovered this function, some guys - for fun - have altered the documents of the other groups. This resulted in the loss of important data.

**2. The solution**

*Therefore*, the teachers decided to manage shared folders from an individual account and to create shared documents for each group that could only be accessed from the components of that specific group.

**3. The context**

In addition to school contexts, this solution can also be adopted in work and / or research contexts, because it could happen that documents shared on Drive are accidentally modified.
