**1. The educational problem**

Students have different experiences of and skills in using specific tools. When introducing new tools to a course some students may already be skilled in using the tools while other students may be unfamiliar with the tools. There is a risk that tools which are suddenly introduced disrupt more than they support individual learning and collaboration among students.

**2. The solution**

*Therefore*, provide time so that each student feels comfortable with a tool that is introduced during the course. A good idea is that the teacher/researcher introduces the tool to the students and students are asked to work individually first with the tool in order to learn how to best use it for themselves. In that way, students have the time to learn the best practices of the tool and how they can best use it before they are asked to use the tool in a team. After getting comfortable with the tool, it will be easier to contribute more efficiently throughout the group work.

**3. The context**

Courses where new tools are introduced and where some students may have more experience of the tools than others. Especially courses where students are expected to collaborate using the tools.
