**1. The educational problem**

Within the class, sometimes you can have one, more or all students presenting some behavioural issues, often disturbing the lesson, or which are just unmotivated.

**2. The solution**

Teachers have adopted different solutions, based on the number of students and kind of issues registered:

-   One “difficult” student: Teachers have personally supported this guy in the creation of a draft spreadsheet to be used for data analysis. The goal was to stimulate his concentration on a specific goal and let him go over some basic math.

-   Many unmotivated students: In these cases, the teacher involved a colleague of his/hers with whom he/she co-managed the time devoted to the KNORK project. In this way the two teachers were able, on the one hand, to manage those students; on the other, to follow more closely the various groups of which the class was made-up for the realization of the work.

-   Almost nobody interested: The teacher defined specific goals in the short term, also including intermediate evaluation tests. The clarity and familiarity of the defined objectives promoted students’ proactive attitude.

**3. The context**

Respectively:

-   In school contexts in which the use of technology could help students recover bad grades. It could also be a mean to motivate students’ with disabilities and to focus their attention.

-   In learning contexts in which there are two or more teachers working together.

-   In working and teaching environments in which the ultimate goal is unfamiliar or not clearly defined.
