**Description of the resource**

Socio-constructivist models imply a complex orchestration of both individual and group activity, which supports students in the construction of many types of artifacts. This complexity calls for the overcome of traditional assessment. Assessment, in fact, should take into account the overall activities, interactions, products and processes of these kind of courses. Moreover, it should sustain students’ responsibility and active role, by becoming an integral part of the learning process, shifting from an *assessment of learning* to an *assessment for learning.* That’s why we developed a protocol for a multi-dimensional assessment of e-learning courses based on socio-constructivist principles. The protocol is the result of over ten years of testing. At the conclusion of each course, feedbacks from students, teachers and tutors have been gathered and used to improve the protocol for the subsequent year. This protocol in meant to reflect its complexity and, at the same time, to promote students’ assumption of responsibility and active role, according to socio-constructivist principles.

The protocol consists of a grid for reporting: group and module identification, individual and collaborative artifacts/processes to be assessed, the owner of the assessment (see the following table).

Some activities, in fact, could be assessed by the teacher or by an e-Tutors only, and some others receive a double assessment. For example, if we consider the collaborative products, the result is evaluated as a group product, with the same score assigned to each group member; whereas the contribution each student offer by participating to the online activities, is evaluated as an individual achievement.

As soon as an activity is completed, the evaluator assigns the score by using a specific Scale. For example, when assessing the “Research-question discussion”, scores are assigned according to these categories: 1=absent participation; 2=few intervention, not focused or useful; 3=few focused/constructive intervention; 4=many focused/constructive intervention; 5= many focused/useful intervention, proactive and collaborative attitude.

**The context**

The assessment protocol hereby described has been developed as part of a university course in e-Learning Psychology. Nevertheless, we believe it can be used flexibly in similar or simpler courses. In fact, it would be sufficient to adapt the grid to the number of groups, modules, evaluators and to the type and number of activities, identifying in advance a suitable scale for their evaluation.

At the end of each module, the assessment grid should be uploaded on the platform, together with the score system description, and students are invited to read and comment on it by using a dedicated discussion forum; in this way, they receive punctual feedback and their capability of self-assessment is modeled. Moreover, since collaborative processes and artifacts receive a double assessment, students have the chance to compare their performance with their group-mates, so to better understand the contribution they are giving to the collaborative knowledge building. Finally, the grid helps students to reflect on the distance between their self-assessment and that of the teacher and e-tutors.

By comparing at the grid at the end of each module, students can take notice of their developmental areas and consequently adjust their learning strategies. At the same time, they can recognize their own progress and the progresses of their group.

At the end of the course, the grid provides to the teacher rich information useful for the final assessment.
