**Educational resource: Presentation of the Design Principles for Trialogical Learning**

**Author(s)**: Minna Lakkala

**Affiliation(s)**: University of Helsinki, Finland

**Date of publication**: March 7, 2016

**Description of the resource**

The resource includes presentation material (in pdf format) of the six Trialogical Design Principles that educators can apply in designing teaching based on the Trialogical Learning Approach (TLA). The presentation is prepared by researchers [*Hanni Muukkonen*](https://tuhat.halvi.helsinki.fi/portal/fi/person/hmuukkon), [*Minna Lakkala*](https://tuhat.halvi.helsinki.fi/portal/fi/person/lakkala), [*Liisa Ilom√§ki*](https://tuhat.halvi.helsinki.fi/portal/fi/person/lilomaki), [*Sami Paavola*](https://tuhat.halvi.helsinki.fi/portal/fi/person/spaavola) from the University of Helsinki. The material includes references to publications that include more information of the theoretical background of TLA and its design principles as well as their application in educational practices. The material is produced for *the Online Teacher Training Package for the Trialogical Learning Approach* developed in the KNORK project.

**The context**

The presentation can be used in any occasion where the TLA is introduced and its implementation in educational practice is discussed. For teachers planning their teaching, one good method is to introduce the six design principles one by one, possible with a short discussion about each principle, and let the participants write into their teaching plans ideas about applying each principle in their own teaching.
