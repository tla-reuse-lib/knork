*Promoting Knowledge Practices in Education (KNORK) http://knork.info*

*The Re-use Library*

**Pedagogical case**: **Electronics for aviation engineering (Electronics, Technical University)**

**Author(s):** Tania Vasileva

**Affiliation(s):** Technical University of Sofia

**Date of publication:** June 16, 2015

**The educational problem**

The educational challenge was:

1. To increase engagement and motivation of students

2. To ensure the quality of learning across subject boundaries

3. To develop skills required by employers:

-   Critical thinking, problem solving, data interpretation and analysis, synthesizing information

-   Self-direction, planning, self-discipline, adaptability, initiative

-   Teamwork, collaboration, cooperation

-   Information and communication technology (ITC) literacy

-   Collaboration across Networks

The problem was how to restructure the broad course of Electronics delivered to future aviation engineers in order to:

-   To ensure better knowledge and competencies of the students

-   Take advantage of tech tools to facilitate learning

-   Use cloud services to create a self-paced, learner-centered classroom

-   Organize activities to ensure an enjoyable implementation experience

**The solution**

In order to achieve these objectives and resolve problems, a new trialogical educational approach was introduced with

-   Using cloud computing technologies to organize environment for collaborative work

-   Applying up-to-date communication tools for student-students and student-teachers connection

-   Continuous monitoring and assistance of students’ activities

Trialogical approach was used to address

-   Team work on shared object (reports)

-   Weekly assignments and continuous work (3 one month long course projects)

-   Continuous monitoring and teacher assistance in this process, providing help on request

-   Reporting on the individual contribution of each team member to the overall project

-   Respect to meeting the deadline (after the prescribed date the project is locked for editing)

**Key experiences**

By integrating technology into learning experiences, students are more engaged in their learning inside and outside of university. Cloud computing environment promotes a dynamic content and course delivery and helps students to exploit computing technology for active learning. The most important feature is collaborative study environment for students and teachers. Shared applications and documents on the cloud, such as Google Apps allow for more social lessons and students get an opportunity to collaborate productively using technology. Students benefit by learning this way, integrating subject-matter knowledge with a better understanding and confidence of using cloud platform for their own professional career plans. Digital technology also allows teachers to keep track of students’ progress all the time without spending hours on marking – thereby creating unprecedented opportunities for personalised learning.

**Detailed description of the pedagogical implementation**

**Background information**

Educational level: Bachelor degree (4<sup>rd</sup> semester)

Topic: Electronics (a compulsory fundamental course for aviation engineering)

Subject domain(s): Electronics, aviation

Duration: 15 weeks

**Learning goals**

The course aims to give knowledge on using basic semiconductor and electronic devices, digital circuits and microprocessors, as well as high frequency vacuum tubes serving this way as a basis for studying next disciplines in the curriculum. Students have to be acquainted with basic semiconductor and electronic devices, their characteristics, parameters and mode of operation, to know functions and organization of digital circuits, microprocessors and microcontrollers, their areas of applications and to obtain new knowledge and skills in this area in correspondence with their needs and interests as well. Obtained knowledge can be used in professional realization of the students as specialists in exploitation, maintenance and repairing of aviation equipment and systems.

**Preparations before the course**

Before the course starts, the following issues are done:

-   Teams’ formation

-   Collection of Gmail accounts of all students

-   Development of documentation templates for the tasks to be done by all: shared weekly assignments and reports of shared project work

-   Create folders for the groups and workspaces

-   Upload learning material

-   Create Google calendar for project development agenda and deadlines

-   Guidelines for students for measuring, calculating parameters, plotting data, graphical determining parameters etc.

-   LTspice tutorial, Gnuplot tutorial, Plotly video clip

**ICT tool(s)**

***Cloud & Communication tools***

Google Tools are used for collaborative development of a common shared object in the cloud – Google Drive, Docs, Sheets; *Google calendar* – to set deadlines and to monitor progress – assignments, intermediate stages reporting, deadline for the submission of the project.

For inter team communications students can choose their preferred tools (chat, conferences, e-mail, forums). For student – teacher communications are used Google applications: Gmail, Calendar, Drive и Google+.

***Specific tools ***

*LTspice*<sup>®</sup> <img src="md\img062/media/image01.png" width="69" height="21" /> – Free Circuit Simulation, Schematic Capture and Waveform Viewer Tool, Gnuplot and Plotly for graphic visualization of measured data.

**Schedule and working phases**

The students need to do collaboratively in teams during the semester several weekly assignments and 3 one month long projects. Taking in consideration our previous experience we decided to replace the whole semester long project with several weekly assignments and 3 one month long projects. This way of working permits more regular work during the semester and facilitate students to perform more complex projects since they already have resolved similar problems step by step during the weekly assignments. This permits more regularly comments and helps from teachers since they monitor easily small tasks in the beginning of the semester. When students starts develop long term projects they are already familiar with the collaborative work and tools and have already passed through some difficult theoretical part, implementing it practically during weekly assignments.

***Phase 1*:** Introduction to course and used tools

-   Pedagogical goals and methods

-   Defining course topics

-   Introduction of assessments criteria

-   Examine tools used in the project and shared reports

***Phase 2*:** Weekly assignments planning

-   Define teams

-   Determine assignments

The goal of weekly assignments is students to pass through all theoretical phases, to resolve problems, to design circuits and do design verification by simulation – tasks they will face combined in long term projects and also to be acquainted and becomes familiar with collaborative tools and other specific subject tools which they will use in the project.

***Phase 3*:** Weekly assignments execution and presentation

-   Arrange assignment organization and management

-   Promote collective responsibility

-   Provide guidance to support advancements

-   Presentation and discussion of assignments

Students work in groups of 2-3 persons on a shared common report, which is continuously monitored, taking into account the individual contribution of each team member.

*Tasks*: The team collaboratively to develop a shared report, which include theoretical questions as well as design and analysis tasks. A number of problems are assigned to be investigated by simulation. The analysis of the obtained results, conclusions and suggestion for improvements are also important part of the work.

*Activities*: schematic capture & graphic drawing, calculation of circuit parameters, circuit design - currents, resistance, design verification by simulation.

***Phase 4*:** Long term projects’ planning

-   Define project teams

-   Determine projects’ assignments

***Phase 5*:** Long term projects’ initiation

-   Arrange project organization and management

-   Establish resources and time frames

-   Promote collective responsibility

***Phase 6*:** Long term projects’ execution

-   Set up assignments that require iteration

-   Provide guidance to support advancement

-   Support building project awareness

-   Guide dynamic changes during development

***Phase 7*:** Face-to-face session

The goal is to discuss common instructions and problems, faced by many students, as well as specific theoretical or practical difficulties of some teams

*Activities:* questions & answers, slides & computer presentations

***Phase 8*:** Long term projects’ presentation and evaluation

-   Set high expectation

-   Provide feedback

-   Explain evaluation criteria

-   Encourage exploitation of project result

**Student evaluation**

Students’ knowledge is evaluated continuously during the semester and by a final exam test. The grade of the shared homework and shared coursework report are based on the following criteria: material/organization, presentation, depth of material interpretation, handling of questions, solving problems, analysis and conclusion on obtained results. Commenting activities and communications between student/students and student/teachers are also appreciated.

The final grade will be based on a total of 5 % quiz grades, 20% shared homework assignments grades, 25% of shared project work grades and 50% of final exam test grade.

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

***What worked well?***

-   Using technologies in which students are already well versed is a powerful way to support independent, enquiry-based learning and peer collaboration.

-   Shared tasks give students an experience of working in teams, managing their own time, and presenting their work – all skills that will be valuable in the workplace. Students learn to have respect to deadline since the reports are locked after the deadline.

-   Students create numerous drafts before producing a final product, there are frequent opportunities to critique each others’ work, and the finished product is exhibited publicly. They also cross the borders between subjects.

-   Online chat, instant messaging and email help to strengthen the student-teacher relationship.

-   Continuous control of the process and the contribution of each participant – notes and comments of the teacher in shared reports during their development in the Google docs’ document.

***What did not work so well?***

-   Problems how to force lazy students to work well.

***How would you improve the solution?***

-   After weekly assignments optimal distribution of students in groups. Not only according to their desire, but taking of consideration their activity in common work.

-   We will distribute part of the tasks in common project personally to each student, so forcing every one of the team to contribute.

-   We will try to organize students to write individually short weekly note or message in a shared system about their progression (currently not enough clear how to stress not enough active students to participate – probably make students comment on each other’s / other groups work throughout the course)

-   We will reward and punish student by bonus points, contributing to their final score.

-   Update the criteria for evaluation of responsibilities in teams, according to the complexity of the project and the individual contribution to each team member.
