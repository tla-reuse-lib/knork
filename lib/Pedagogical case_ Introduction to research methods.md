**Pedagogical case: Introduction to research methods (Social Sciences, University)**

**Author(s):** Liisa Myyry, Minna Lakkala & Liisa Ilomäki

**Affiliation(s)**: University of Helsinki, Finland

**Date of publication**: April 21, 2016

**The educational problem**

The described course was an introduction to research methods intended for international students at the beginning of their master’s degree studies. The course was earlier based on individual tasks and short-term group tasks (e.g. group discussions) in contact meetings. Separate small tasks are perhaps not best in supporting the comprehension of research planning as a larger entity. More challenging and concrete co-creational task might also motivate students to engage better in completing the tasks.

**The solution**

The course practices simulated a real process of creating a research plan in small groups based on common research interests. Each group member in turn was as a chair taking care of timetables and group work activities. The course included weekly 2-hour contact sessions over seven weeks. In the first three meetings, students started their group work and were guided in the process, for instance by brief presentations by the teacher. In meetings four to six, two groups presented one part of the research plan to others in class (e.g., how to set relevant research questions or research ethics), also receiving peer feedback from another group, and then the teacher discussed with each group about the progress of their group work. The last meeting was a poster session: students were divided in mixed groups that went through all posters so that the member who had participated in making the plan presented his/her group’s poster to others. Each student also wrote an individual learning diary. The Moodle platform was used for common activities, sharing materials and group communication. In addition, the groups prepared their plans, presentations and posters using a free choice of digital tools.

**Key experiences**

The basic idea and structure of the course was successful, and the students appeared motivated to complete the tasks. The timetable was a bit tight. Some student groups did not use the Moodle forum for their group communication, hence the teacher was not able to follow their progress outside contact sessions; instructions and guidance for that could be improved. It was interesting to have multicultural groups, but some groups worked better than others.

**Implementing the trialogical design principles**

| DP1: Organising activities around shared objects                                             | A group task to produce a research plan, present one aspect of the research plan as an oral presentation, and a poster introducing the research plan at the end of the course.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| DP2: Supporting integration of personal and collective agency and work                       | The research plan topic was negotiated between group members. Each member of a group was in turn responsible for taking care of timetables and group work. Assessment based on the evaluation of group products.                                                                                                                                |
| DP3: Emphasizing development and creativity through knowledge transformations and reflection | A complete working process with one large task (creating a research plan) conducted through several iterations and presentation modes. Peer commenting on group presentations.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| DP4: Fostering long-term processes of knowledge advancement                                  | The research plans were made throughout the course. Each group in turn presented one aspect of the research plan to other participants; so the group products were used also as training materials for other participants during the course. The course was supposed to support planning the research for master's thesis later in the studies. |
| DP5: Promoting cross-fertilization of knowledge practices and artifacts across communities   | Course practices modelled the process of making and presenting a real research plan. The participants were international students from various background and study fields, which also created possibilities for cross-fertilization.                                                                                                           |
| DP6: Providing flexible tools for developing artifacts and practices                         | Timetables, guidelines and group products were shared through Moodle, and each group had a discussion forum through which they could coordinate their work. The student groups used various applications by their own choice to create presentations.                                                                                           |

**Detailed description of the pedagogical implementation**

**Background information**

Educational level: Master level

Topic: Research Methods

Subject domain(s): Social Sciences

Duration: 7 weeks, two hours per week

**Learning goals**

The goals of the course were to learn to write a research plan and select research methods appropriate for the planned research process. In particular, the aim was to learn: to set relevant research questions, to design a study based on the research questions, to operationalize theoretical concepts, to be able to identify research ethical issues, to be able to present one’s ideas to others and justify them and to give constructive feedback to peers.

**Preparations before the course**

It is important to check the teaching time of the course with the coordinators of all international master programs so that students from as many programs as possible are able to participate. It is also good to take into account other ideas and hopes that come from the coordinators.

Good practice is to construct the basic structure of the course area in Moodle well in advance, and then top it up during the course.

**ICT tool(s)**

Moodle was used as a common platform for the whole course. Time tables, instructions and presentations were shared through it, and each student group had a discussion forum in the course area in Moodle to coordinate their work.

**Schedule and working phases**

| *Week* | *Topic*                                                                                                         |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Week 1 | Introduction: course structure and assignments, introduction to Moodle, starting the group work                 |
| Week 2 | Organizing the group work and clarifying its topic                                                              |
| Week 3 | Checking the proceedings of group works                                                                         |
| Week 4 | Group presentations and feedback: formulating research questions and how to operationalize theoretical concepts |
| Week 5 | Group presentations and feedback: how to design a research and ethical issues in research                       |
| Week 6 | Group presentations and feedback: how to do methodological decisions and how to decide about data collection    |
| Week 7 | Poster session                                                                                                  |

Between face-to-face meetings, there was online learning and group work about 9 hours/week. Students were also provided with a timetable for the group work with guidelines about how to proceed on each week.

**Student evaluation**

The scale from 0 (failed) to 5 (excellent) was used in grading. Group work and group process (including presentation, feedback and poster) formed 80% of the final grade, individual learning journal formed of 20% of the final grade.

Assessment criteria for the group work and group process:

| 0/5   | No effort to complete the assignments. The assignments are disorganized, the choices are invalid and they are not justified. The formal instructions of the assignments are not complied. There are severe problems in the group process: contribution of the participants is unequal, the group couldn’t agree on timetable, contribution and working methods. |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2/5 | Some effort to complete the assignments. The assignments are quite disorganized, the choices are invalid or they are not justified at all. The formal instructions may be followed. Some problems in the group process: contribution might be unequal, the group could agree on some practical issues but not all.                                              |
| 3/5   | All or most of the assignments are completed with effort. The assignments are well organized and clear. The choices are mostly valid but they are not sufficiently justified. The formal instructions are well complied. Only few problems in group process: contribution is quite equal, and the group could agree on most of the practical issues.            |
| 4/5   | All the assignments are completed with effort. The assignments are well organized and clear. The choices are valid and they are mostly well justified. The formal instructions are well complied. No problems in the group process: the contribution is equal and if not, well justified, practical issues worked well.                                         |
| 5/5   | Like in 4/5 but the assignments are well justified and argumentation is convincing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Assessment criteria for the learning journal:

| 0/5   | No identification of relevant concepts and no effort to complete the assignment.                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2/5 | Some identification of relevant concepts but the significance of them is not grasped, some effort to complete the assignment. The student can list things that she/he has learned but cannot describe them.                             |
| 3/5   | The assignment is completed with effort. The student can describe and apply the relevant concepts and what she/he has learned but their significance for the whole is missing, learning is mostly described as what the student can do. |
| 4/5   | The assignment is completed with effort. The student can compare, explain and analyze relevant concepts and what she/he has learned and she/he understands the significance of the parts in relation to the whole.                      |
| 5/5   | Like in 4/5 but the student can also generalize and reflect the knowledge as well as transfer it to other contexts.                                                                                                                     |

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

The described course was run by one lecturer, and 26 students completed the course. The basic idea and structure of the course was successful, and the students appeared motivated to complete the tasks. The timetable was a bit tight. Some student groups did not use the Moodle forum for their group communication, hence the teacher was not able to follow their progress outside contact sessions; instructions and guidance for that could be improved. It was interesting to have multicultural groups, but some groups worked better than others.

The students appreciated the comprehensiveness of the course content, fair workload, online availability of materials, good instructions, multicultural assembly of participants, and real work processes and responsibility given for students. The students reported learning more content knowledge, expert practices, knowledge applicable in practice, and working in teams. Group work was also challenging, related to uneven commitment to group work and difficulties to find time for group meetings, ineffective collaboration at some points, and different backgrounds of participants. Some students would have wanted deeper examination of theory, more expert lectures and a possibility to work alone, which might reflect study practices that they were used to in their home countries.

Below are some comments written by students about the positive and impressive aspects of the course:

-   “It was positive that I got a condensed overview and small experience of research planning.”

-   “It was also interesting to listen to other groups' research proposals and to hear of a variety of different approaches that people took to the social sciences.”

-   “But looking at this experience in a positive way, I would say that it had strengthened my ability to cope with or work with different teams.”

-   “The high-quality group presentations in particular have positively impressed me.
