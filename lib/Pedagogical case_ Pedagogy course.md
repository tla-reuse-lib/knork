*The Re-use Library*

**Pedagogical case: “Pedagogical scenarios for school and universities” course (Pedagogy, University)**

**Author(s)**: Donatella Cesareni & Nadia Sansone

**Affiliation(s)**: University of Rome Sapienza, Italy

**Date of publication**: March 5, 2015

**The educational problem**

Sapienza Psychology Students always complain about the total lack of concreteness in their course of study, based essentially on professorial lecture and individual study of theories, without any possibility of implementing them, all at the expense of students’ motivation to participate actively in their own learning process. In my course, I tried to overcome this issue and offer a practice way, as well as collaborative, of learning and applying what students have learned.

**The solution**

We used the trialogical approach to design activities that allow students to become active builder of their own knowledge, by creating collaboratively artifacts and designing possible applications of the theories studied. Moreover, thanks to the trialogical DP, we finalized the activities to creating products useful and meaningful, thus motivating students towards the study of my discipline.

**Key experiences**

Our main success was students’ epistemic activation, who have felt active protagonists of what they were creating and learning together. In the final interviews we have performed, they have stated, among other things, how the course allowed them to discover the opportunity to learn by discussing with colleagues – which was highly unexpected to them-, to be able to manage their own learning process and bring their ideas in it, going beyond what is presented in the didactic materials and texts.

From these readings, the students together defined the theoretical basis of the project to be realized. A second task was the collection, analysis and commentary on some significant experiences that could be useful to the project: even here, starting from an individual reading and analysis of the characteristics of the project, students shared features useful for the realization Project with the group.  |

Building on the work of the synthesizers, each group could reflect on the work already done and on the open issues, improve and build on these ideas to create artifacts.

The reading of the grids allowed the group to reflect on their participation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| DP4: Fostering long-term processes of knowledge advancement                                  | The intake of specific roles within groups and the rotation of them allowed the groups to work independently and to progress in the construction of artifacts. In addition to the roles above-mentioned, which are important for the improvement of ideas, two other functional roles were allocated in each group.

| DP5: Promoting cross-fertilization of knowledge practices and artifacts across communities   | The work of each small group were presented in the classroom, and discussed by teachers and students in the large group. In this way, it was possible to compare experiences, skills and knowledge that were developing within each group. This process became particularly visible in the final confrontation between the 3 groups about the projects dedicated to the school or college that they had realized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| DP6: Providing flexible tools for developing artifacts and practices                         | During the activities, we used different tools. Students interacted in small groups within a Moodle course set up with forums dedicated to free discussion or specific tasks. In order to perform the different activities, we suggested tools such Padlet (which students used for brainstorming in the classroom), Google drive drawing tools (to create shared concept maps), and spreadsheets (to collaboratively write the project).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

**Detailed description of the pedagogical implementation**

**Background information**

Educational level: University Bachelor, third year (21 years old)

Topic: Learning and Instruction, Technology for learning

Subject domain(s): Pedagogy

Duration: 3 months

**Learning goals**

*Contents*

The main models of teaching and learning, with particular reference to the models of active school (Dewey) and collaborative learning. The class as a community of learners and knowledge builders. Learning reading and writing. The history and laws of school practices. Technologies and collaborative learning.

*Skills*

Ability to read and interpret research results in education. Ability to work in groups. Be able to use technologies to work in a team.

**Preparations before the course**

Careful design of the course and materials. Preparation of the interactive spaces within the MOODLE platform. Division of students into working groups of 8-9 people.

**ICT tool(s)**

Students’ interactions took place both face to face and online; for online interactions, we used the Moodle platform, opening a course for each group of students and inserting tools for collaborative work in it.

An important trick to avoid disorientation from users is "to let grow" the environment with the activity of the group. Therefore, at the beginning, the environments had few elements visible to the students:

-   A space devoted to the news in which the teacher and tutors put notices of general interest,

-   A "virtual chat": a forum in which to develop social relationships,

-   The CKP initial questionnaire that the students were asked to answer online, realized through a Google form in Drive;

-   The first planned activity: a discussion forum on the "good teacher” figure

During the weeks, new discussion forums were gradually incorporated, as well a study materials and links to different instruments were shared.

Moodle has proven to be very useful to share materials and discuss. We also used some others ICT tools:

-   Padlet for classroom brainstorming and to create a “showcase of ideas”;

-   Google Drawings to build and share conceptual maps;

**The tasks and activities in each phase and how they are organized**

Module 1

-   Students’ role taking: social tutor, skeptic, synthesizer, responsible of the artifact (map), collaborative activity observer.

-   Online discussion about “the good teacher” (MOODLE)

-   Movie viewing and discussion

-   Face to face and online collaborative work,

-   Creating the conceptual map Google drive)

-   Work presentation in plenary.

Module 2

-   Students’ role taking

-   Online discussion about “learning to read and write” (MOODLE)

-   Interview with preschool children and collection of their spontaneous writings

-   Online sharing (MOODLE) and analysis according to Ferreiro & Teberotskji analysis model

-   Face-to-face collaborative work in class in order to refine the analysis and build the presentation (PowerPoint)

-   Work presentation in plenary

Module 3

-   Students’ role taking

-   Collective brainstorming on the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology in learning (Padlet)

-   Reading articles exposing methods and theories in support of CSCL and Knowledge Building. Division into subgroups of reading

-   Request to: emphasize and report key steps, critical points or interesting items for discussion; discuss the most interesting aspects to be put as a theoretical basis of the project to be built (MOODLE)

-   Reading research articles presenting experiences of use of technology in teaching; sharing and highlighting the most interesting aspects

-   F2F collaborative work on the design of an educational activity to be continued online (Google document for the drafting of the project, forums for discussion)

-   Work presentation in plenary

-   Critical reflection on the learning activity (questionnaire and classroom discussion)

**Student evaluation**

Students’ participation in the activity was an integral part of the assessment. Participation was assessed not in terms of quantity, but in terms of quality, that is, how their contribution was relevant to the collaborative knowledge building of the group (e.g., taking into account the ideas of others, proposing new ideas, reflecting on process and content). The evaluation was then provided to the group at the end of each module, and the group could intervene to propose changes in the assessment.

During classroom group activities, a student in turn was in charge of filling out a grid of observation of group collaborative activities, which students discussed together. At the end of the whole activity, the students took a written examination with respect to the knowledge to be acquired.

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

Students’ depth discussions, expressing more refined concepts than those usually proposed in a classroom debate.

Involvement of each and any students in the Group (only one student, in fact, had no positive evaluation).

In one group, there was some tension due to the difficulty to agree about the shared project, actually, since they had planned activities too difficult to be concretely implemented. It was necessary to help them downsize their expectations, bringing them back to an easier task.
