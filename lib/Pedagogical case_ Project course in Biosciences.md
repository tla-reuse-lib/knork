**Pedagogical case: Project course in Biosciences (Biosciences, University)**

**Author(s):** Jukka T. Lehtonen and Minna Lakkala

**Affiliation(s)**: University of Helsinki, Finland

**Date of publication**: June 21s, 2016

**The educational problem**

The central reason for creating the course was that in the feedback that the faculty of Bio- and Environmental Sciences had received both from alumni, graduates and employees, the competences of project planning and management were emphasized as important skills in working life. Such competences were taught little in the faculty. There emerged a desire to provide master students with opportunities to learn project work practices and apply theoretical domain knowledge that they have learned during their studies in solving practical real world problems.

**The solution**

The head instructor with two assistant instructors organized a course where students’ carried out a customer project for a real customer organization. An external expert gave students initial project work training. Teamwork was organized by an agreed policy, according to which the chairman and the secretary were replaced every two weeks. The students themselves decided how many study points they wanted to achieve and allocated time for the course and project work accordingly. The whole class had three joint meetings during the course. Otherwise the teams worked independently; for example, meetings with the clients and the tutoring instructor. In the course meetings, the teams presented their work progression and outcomes and received feedback from peer students, instructors and clients. A wiki platform was used for common course activities, the sharing of materials and group communication. In addition, the student teams took into use some cloud services (e.g., Google docs) for their co-authoring needs.

**Key experiences**

Generally, the students’ experienced the course very positively. Students appreciated group work, real work processes and responsibility given for them, but collaboration was also mentioned as being difficult. There were some problems with the uneven commitment to group work and difficulties to find time for group meetings. Students were impressed by the learning of expert practices and high quality group work results as well skills for real work life.

The instructors were also mainly satisfied with the course, especially the commitment and active participation of the clients and the high quality outcomes that the student teams produced. One challenging issue was the size of student teams; one team had 7 participants which was considered a too large group to be functional.

| DP1: Organising activities around shared objects                                             | Demanding project work was conducted in teams throughout the course, and a real project plan was produced for an external customer by each team. Opiskelijat ovat tuottaneet kurssilla selvityksiä tai hankesuunnitelmia, joista on laadittu raportti sekä suullinen esitelmä kurssin loppuseminaariin.                                                                     |
| DP2: Supporting integration of personal and collective agency and work                       | Students chose the project according to their interests and decided how many study points they wanted to achieve, and each student allocated efforts to group work and course tasks accordingly. The students kept a record of their working hours. Each student was in turn responsible for leading the group work. Assessment was based on group activities and products. |
| DP3: Emphasizing development and creativity through knowledge transformations and reflection | The project work required integration of theoretical and applied domain knowledge as well as knowledge and skills about project work. Both the students, lecturers and customers evaluated the team outcomes repeatedly in group and course meetings.                                                                                                                       |

**Detailed description of the pedagogical implementation**

**Background information**

Educational level: Master students in university

Topic: Project work

Subject domain(s): Bio- and environmental sciences

Duration: About three months, whole autumn term

**Learning goals**

The goals of the course were the following:

-   Learn to plan and manage projects in small teams and to apply theoretical domain knowledge into practice:

-   Learn to use the Logical Framework Approach in project planning;

-   Receive genuine working life contacts;

-   Be better aware of one’s own abilities and skills, and get more courage from it.

**Preparations before the course**

The course leader contacted the possible customers exploiting his existing networks. He negotiated with the customers about their role and the suitability of the project assignments. Efforts were made to select assignments that allow creative work and are suitable for the students in the faculty both concerning the scope and required competences. The course schedule, instructions and templates for team processes were planned and prepared together with the three course instructors.

The students were selected for the course based on a motivation letter and a curriculum vitae that they submitted to apply for the course. In the motivation letter, the students were asked to describe why they want to participate in the course, what are their goals concerning the course and future working life, and which of the offered project assignments interested them most.

**ICT tool(s)**

Public wiki platform was used for sharing and coordinating the processes in the whole course. It was useful that also the clients were able to access the wiki. In addition, student teams used various cloud services based on their own choice for their communication and co-authoring needs. They communicated and sent the various versions of the project report for clients mainly through e-mail.

**Schedule and working phases**

In addition to the training for project planning and management, kick-off meeting, mid-term meeting and final seminar, there were not any other joint meetings in the course. Student teams did their work quite independently, but they received guidance and support from their clients and tutoring teachers through direct contacts and in team meetings.

The schedule of the course was the following:

-   September 12th: Kick-off meeting

-   Weeks 37-39: First team meeting

-   September 25th-27th: Project management training

-   Independent working in teams

-   October 15th: Mid-term meeting

-   Independent working in teams

-   December 12th: Final seminar

**Student evaluation**

Each student team was given a grade of the project they conducted. Evaluation criteria were the influence, realism, compliance with the goal, clarity and innovativeness.

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

In all, 15 students in three student teams participated in the first implementation of the course design, and each team had their own customer. The topics of the team projects related to a guidebook for ethical fish consumption, making a plant management plan for an island, and to the mitigation of the harmful effects of Barnacle.

Generally, the students’ experienced the course very positively; e.g., “I was very pleased that I participated and was accepted in the course. The course was an awesome addition to otherwise very lecture-based courses. I liked it a lot.” Students appreciated group work, real work processes and responsibility given for them, but collaboration was also mentioned as being difficult. There were some problems with the uneven commitment to group work and difficulties to find time for group meetings. Students were impressed by the learning of expert practices and high quality group work results as well skills for real work life.

The instructors were also mainly satisfied with the course, especially the commitment and active participation of the clients and the high quality outcomes that the student teams produced. One challenging issue was the size of student teams; one team had 7 participants which was considered a too large group to be functional.
