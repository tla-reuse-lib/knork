**The educational problem**

The educational problem is how to easily, and without extra costs, support virtual collaboration and interaction for creating presentations, reports or personal stories.

**The solution**

Sway is a presentation program, which can be freely used to easily create and share interactive reports, presentations, personal stories and more. The user can create a new presentation by clicking the new “Sway” button or can import a document such as Word, PowerPoint, PDF from where he/she can take the data he/she wishes to use for the Sway.

In the Sway, the user can edit the design of the presentation he/she wishes to create, can insert a number of choices such as Text, Media (e.g. picture, video, Tweet, chart) or a Group (e.g. slideshow, grid) and can even edit the way Sway navigates by either scrolling it vertically or horizontally.

Sway can be easily shared to other social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn etc. or it can even be embedded in another page by copying the embed code provided. Sway can also be shared with others for either viewing or editing depending on the editor’s preferences.

**Key experiences**

Sway was released by Microsoft on August 2015 and has not yet been implemented in a course to share student experiences. The goal is to promote it even further to the students due to the flexibility and opportunities for collaboration and interactivity that it offers.
