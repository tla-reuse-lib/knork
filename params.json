{"name":"Knork","tagline":"Promoting Knowledge Work Practices in Education","body":"The KNORK project provides easily applicable pedagogical approaches supporting novel knowledge work and digital competencies. In the project, we develop and test pedagogical methods, digital tools and teacher training models to improve these competencies and practices in secondary and higher education.\r\n\r\nFor the pedagogical approach, we apply the “trialogical” learning that defines principles for sophisticated collaborative knowledge creation practices. Such principles are, e.g., the rich use of technology and cross-fertilization practices between educational levels as well as educational institutions and work life organizations. The KNORK project builds on two previous projects, Knowledge Practices Laboratory (KP-Lab) and Promoting Working Life Competences in University Education (ProWo).\r\n\r\nThe pedagogical models and supportive technologies will be experimented and refined in Bulgaria, Finland, Italy and Sweden. All development work in the project will be made in collaboration between researchers, teachers and other experts through workshops, field-testing and co-design activities.\r\n\r\nAs outcomes, we produce new teaching methods and inter-institutional collaboration practices for the participating institutions; pedagogical examples, materials and digital tools to be disseminated and re-used by educators in secondary and tertiary education in Europe. In addition, we create guidelines and scientific reports for policy makers and educational authorities. An online teacher training package and pedagogical support material will be put openly available to promote the re-use of project outcomes among educators, researchers and other stakeholders.\r\n\r\nKNORK is financially supported by European Commission, from the Life Long Learning Programme.\r\n\r\nFor more info, please contact\r\nLiisa Ilomäki, liisa.ilomaki@helsinki.fi\r\nRoberto Righi, rrighi@stepseurope.it","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
