**The educational problem**

The educational challenge was to increase motivation of students to learn, to enhance their professional and digital competences and to meet the requirements of business to future employees for:

-   Abilities to resolve complex problems;

-   Better practical training (experience in using professional software and CAD tools);

-   Working on multidisciplinary tasks, utilizing multiple knowledge sources;

-   Abilities to work in group;

-   Abilities to use rich computer technologies and environments.

-   Networking;

The problem was how to restructure the ASIC Design course in order to:

-   Increase students motivation providing them with practically oriented projects;

-   Increase students’ knowledge and competencies,

-   Increase students’ abilities to work collaboratively with individual responsibility to the quality of common product.

**The solution**

To resolve the above mentioned problems, we redesign the course using trialogical design principles and modern digital technology. The course was restructured from traditional face-to-face to project oriente, adopting and applying modern online learning platforms, cloud collaboration tools and social software. Overall, the trialogical approach is well accepted and considered as an appropriate path for transforming students’ individual course work into more collaborative activities. Instead of giving students many separate tasks we provide them with a large three month long project, continuous working process, shared research plan and final presentation in groups. All group activities are organized around shared objects – collaborative development of a common project, and preparation of a shared report.

**Key experiences**

Working in small teams, the students are required to design a digital Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). The design workflow is based on HDL (Hardware Design Language) modelling, verification and synthesis. The main design artefacts (VHDL models and test-benches) are text files; therefore we are able to borrow many tools and workflows from the software development community. Projects are hosted on GitHub – one repository per project. In parallel with the code development, the teams are required to create and maintain a Google Docs document which is one of the major deliverables. Initially the document contains the technical specifications of the design. Later on, the students have to add description of the implemented algorithms and architectures, argumentation of the tradeoffs made and the results from the simulation, synthesis and physical design.

Most of development takes place outside the regular classes. For their intra-team communication, the students are free to choose whatever tools they prefer (chat, conferencing, email). For student - teacher communications we decided to use the Google tools. Students were encouraged to submit their questions as emails instead of chat messages.

**Implementing the trialogical design principles**

**DP1: Organizing activities around shared objects**

Collaborative development of 3 months long common project, preparation of a shared report.

Activities: face to face meeting for the distribution of project tasks, defining and preliminary review of the tools used; getting students acquainted with the phases of the design cycle.

Team organization: creating GitHub and Google accounts, giving students ability to choose team partner and form the team according their interest and previous experience.

Task distribution between the teams, offering lists of possible projects themes. Students have also an opportunity to offer a theme of their interest (based on working tasks in the company, future diploma project etc.). The relevance of these need to be approved by the teacher.

**DP2: Supporting integration of personal and collective agency and work**

Coordinate the participants’ interests – team members to choose an appropriate project they want to develop and are interested in.

Motivate students to manage tasks distribution between team members, having respect to deadlines by giving each student the responsibility of being a team leader in turn. There are two strictly defined deadlines during the project cycle and performing tasks within given deadlines is one of the criteria for project evaluation.

Combining participants' own interests and shared project through assessment process – the quality of the shared project and the responsibilities concerning deadlines are evaluated with a better grade.

**DP3: Emphasizing development and creativity through knowledge transformations and reflection**

Support versatile use of various kinds of knowledge: theoretical or literary sources; practical examples and cases; pictures, models. Discuss problems student faced during collective work on the shared object.

Reflect on collective practices and knowledge.

Make students comment on each other’s work through the semester.

Encourage students to independently and creatively initiate, lead and manage a development process.

Require student to apply already obtained knowledge and skills in using professional CAD tools to resolve complex practical tasks.

**DP4: Fostering long-term processes of knowledge advancement**

Continuous working process, iterative design process to improve circuit performance in order to fulfill technical specifications. Team members have collaborator rights for the respective repositories, but they are asked not to commit directly. Each change had to be peer reviewed before it can be committed to the project repository.

Planning and start writing the documents, sharing the drafts, getting feedback from the teacher and other students, improving the project and project report, submitting relevant documents.

Using forums and blogs for discussing problems and exchanging views and opinions.

The best final team projects and their shared reports are used during the course as good examples for other teams, as well as after the course by the students themselves or by others.

**DP5: Promoting cross-fertilization of knowledge practices and artifacts across communities**

Students use professional tools for projects development. They are provided with professional work models and design flow cycle used in the software and electronic industry.

Expert practices are modeled for students, via templates and tools.

Students and teachers collaborate on solving a shared problem.

Students use up-to-date cloud computing and communication tools for planning, organizing and writing shared reports.

**DP6: Providing flexible tools for developing artifacts and practices**

Google Drive, Docs, Sheets for collaborative editing of the project reports, reviewing and commenting.

Google calendar – to set deadlines and to monitor progress – assignments, intermediate stages reporting, deadline for submission of the project.

For inter-team communications students can choose their preferred tools (chat, conferences, e-mail, forums).

For student – teacher communications Google applications are used : Gmail, Calendar, Drive and Google+.

Projects are hosted on GitHub – one repository per project.

**Detailed description of the pedagogical implementation**

**Background information**

Educational level: bachelor degree – 4-th year of study

Topic: ASIC Design

Subject domain(s): Electronics

Duration: 15 weeks

**Learning goals**

The goal is students to learn core curriculum as they work on the project. The course considers the architectures, areas of applications and design automation tools for various programmable ASIC (application-specific integrated circuits) types - CPLD and FPGA. Students are introduced to design methodology based on VHDL modelling, simulation and synthesis. The design flow includes also physical design, implementation and testing of the student's projects on FPGA design boards. Strategies for delay optimisations, resources utilisation and the use of embedded microprocessors are also discussed.

At the end of the course the students are expected:

-   To give knowledge on design and implementation of digital IC with programmable integrated circuits (PLD, CPLD and FPGA) – their architecture, characteristics, design verification, manner of specialization and testability so that students can choose appropriate for given area of application.

-   To provide students with hands-on experience on applying hardware description language (VHDL or Verilog) design methodology to design ASICs, using professional Xilinx design automation tools.

**Preparations before the course**

Before the course starts, the following issues are done:

-   Team formation

-   GitHub and Gmail accounts of all students

-   Development of documentation template for final report

-   Guidelines for students for practical sessions

-   Tutorials for used Xilinx CAD tools

-   Defining the project themes

-   Explication of pedagogical aims and methods

-   Negotiation of project assignments

**ICT tool(s)**

The infrastructure for collaborative learning consists of public cloud based services, combined in a way that supports electronic design workflow.

Google Tools are used for collaborative development of a common shared object in the cloud – Google Drive, Docs, Sheets; *Google calendar* – to set deadlines and to monitor progress – assignments, intermediate stages reporting, deadline for submission of the project.

For inter team communications students can choose their preferred tools (chat, conferences, e-mail, forums). For student – teacher communications are used Google applications: Gmail, Calendar, Drive and Google+.

**Schedule and working phases**

Project based learning approach is used. The goal is that students learn core curriculum as they work on the 3 months long project, to go through all stages of the design cycle, and to acquire skills in teamwork and in the creation of common shared documents. Students work in groups of 3-4 persons on a shared common project and report, which is continuously monitored, taking into account the individual contribution of each team member.

**Project initiation phase** includes activities as follows:

-   Arrange project organization and management

-   Establish timeframes, intermediate and final deadlines

-   Link project phases to professional practices

-   Facilitate tool and environment reception

-   Promote collective responsibility and identity

-   Define rules and criteria for group work

**Project execution** involves activities as:

-   Setting up assignments that require iterations of contributions

-   Providing guidance and facilitation to support advancement

-   Guiding dynamic changes in the planned ways of working

-   Supporting dealing with complexity

-   Providing model for expected outcomes

From the students perspective, according the professional practices the main phases of the working process during the project execution include:

-   Specification,

-   VHDL description and simulation,

-   Synthesis to appropriate Xilinx PLD or FPGA chip,

-   Place and route, real chip configuration and testing.

Project report has to explain circuit functionality, VHDL code, result of simulation, synthesis output and chip configuration file.

**Project presentation** and evaluation includes

-   Providing feedback on process and outcomes

-   Encouraging exploitation of project outcomes

-   Explanations on faced difficulties and suggestions for improvements are encouraged.

**Student evaluation**

The assessment is based on the project result. Clear evaluation criteria were stated before starting the project development. Project complexity, professional skills, (teacher responsibility), quality of written materials (peers review), quality of presentation (public defense) and deadline respect are most important.

Writing collaboratively, however, needs coordination and awareness of who has done what. Each student's activity and contributions to the collaborative project is influential (but not definitive) in determining the final grade. On the other hand, being able to analyze how the project report evolved over time can reveal interesting patterns of collaborative writing.

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

Project development in such a practice permits for self-selected time and place allocation of the participants and teachers. Playing (and learning) with new technologies is fun. Although the students had no previous experience with version control and code review tools, they were not intimidated. Most of them enjoyed playing with the new toys and learning “cool” new skills. Guidance is provided through systematic instructions and group work rules. This approach permits educational methods of direct student-educator contact that are not face-to-face, but are mediated through new communications technologies. Online communication allows students and academics to remain separated by space and time, but to sustain an ongoing dialogue. The immediacy of the help provided via email, compared to the scheduled face to face meeting, was cited as a major plus in the post-course surveys. Students were doing most of the development during the weekends and evenings (some of them are already part-time working in the companies). Being able to receive a timely advice on their design problems was highly regarded. The students were more motivated and challenged to work on relatively complex projects by using up-to-date tools and environments which they see in use in the companies.

The introduction of relatively complex, “real world” design workflows and tools highlighted even more the difference between the motivated teams and the students that just wanted to “get over it”. This observation was confirmed by the scores distribution – most were clustered in the top and bottom of the scale with very few in between. There are also difficulties in precise evaluation of personal contribution of each team member to common work.

To improve the solution we intend to define criteria for evaluation of responsibilities in teams, according to the complexity of the project. To stimulate not enough active students to participate will force students to comment on each other’s or other groups’ work, and the teachers will give bonuses in final mark for provided peer review. To facilitate the exploration of collaboratively created project artefacts, we developed a new application for analyzing Google Docs revision histories.
