**Pedagogical Case: Guide for Combi Oven-Convention Steamer (Physics and Italian, Vocational School)**

<span id="_lpvrjckw5ch" class="anchor"></span>

<span id="_gjdgxs" class="anchor"></span>**Author(s)**: Palmisano N. (Teacher of Physics) and Brunetti A. (Teacher of Italian language)

**Affiliation(s)**: I.I.S.S. “G. Salvemini” - Vocational Education and Training for Cooks and Hotel Managers - Fasano (BR) Italy

**Date of publication**: January 20, 2016

July 20th 2015 – reference school year 2013/14.

Annex: “Comparing First/Second experimentations” (school year 2013/14 and 2014/15).

**The educational problem**

The experiment was done in physics and Italian language disciplines in a first class of Vocational Education and Training for Cooks and Hotel Managers consisting of 16 students of 14-15 years of age.

Reasons that pushed to start the experimentation:

1.  Difficulties in teaching Physics, because is a new discipline for this kind of institute and with a numbers of hours per week very low (only two). For this reason teacher of Physics involved the teacher of Italian in the experimentation.

2.  The physics teacher was in his second year of teaching; previously he carried out, for about 20 years, design activities for electrical, instrumentation and automation systems, and activities of project management for the planning and construction of plants in the petrochemical industry. The change between the previous job and the school was radical; the teacher noted the "distance" between the education of school and the workplace who knew. For this reason teacher felt the need to identify appropriate tools for teaching in order to bring together these two worlds inexplicably so far.

**The solution**

KNORK project was the right opportunity to achieve new tools that would allow to implement an educational process stimulating and motivating for students and could then be decisive for a quality vocational training.

In order to address educational problem, the following methodologies have been used:

-   focus on individual and collaborative learning strategies;

-   the use of technologies;

-   the creation of shared and meaningful object.

-   Brainstorming and group work.

Crucial was the choice of Object of Trialogical approach: Guide for Combi Oven-Convention Steamer. The choice of this object was made for following reasons:

1.  because the Oven is an equipment used in professional kitchens of the school; it is used also by the student of first class.

2.  because to create an explanatory and synthetic guide on the functioning, and aimed at users of the oven (Teachers and students of the Kitchen Course within the school itself, restaurant owners, Home Users) was a real opportunity to stimulate and motivate the students.

3.  because the equipment “Combi Oven-Convention Steamer” is closely related to their future profession.

**Key experiences**

The main success have been the **Student Satisfaction** manifested through the motivation during the activities but especially at the end of the course when they were able to “see and touch” the object realized.

**Materials and links**

Materials

-   Manual of Combi Oven-Convention Steamer (Zanussi supplier). The manual was supplied by the school; pdf format has been uploaded to Google Drive and was a valid reference for the students for the search of information in order to realize the Guide.

**Detailed description of the pedagogical implementation**

**Background information**

**Educational level**: First class of Vocational Education and Training for Cooks and Hotel Managers

**Topic**: Guide for Combi Oven-Convention Steamer

**Subject domain(s)**: Physics course

**Duration**: Two months

**Learning goals**

**Physics** – contents:

-   Temperature and main effects of its changes;

-   the heat, transfer and energy transformations;

-   thermal equilibrium conditions;

-   convection and steam.

**Italian Language** – contents:

-   regulative texts: definitions, characteristics and classifications;

-   expository texts: definitions, characteristics and classifications.

**Physics** – skills:

-   Thermal balance analysis;

-   Analysis and interpretation of heat transfer modes: conduction, convection and radiation.

**Italian Language** – skills:

-   produce texts for logbooks;

-   properly use of Italian language to produce regulatory texts: the guide of the oven;

-   to read and understand texts of various types of text (regulatory and exhibition / information) and obtain information for a purpose;

-   Rework the information for construction of a text regulatory (the guide ot the oven)

Learning goals above described are for both disciplines.

Below we detail goals referred to the 6 principles of the trialogical method:

-   to promote the use of new technologies;

-   to promote interaction between individual and group work;

-   to recover motivation to learn by the students through the proposal to produce a concrete object usable by potential customers, and that they can use in the kitchen laboratory.

**Preparations before the course**

-   to evaluate skills of students related to the use of personal computer and basic software for typed documents (as word);

-   to check if all students have google account (gmail and password). Usually it happens that students have android spartphone and gmail account but they don’t remember the password; in some cases it is possible to activate password recovery procedure but in some others cases it is necessary to create a new account. This activities can take some hours of lessons.

**ICT tool(s)**

ICT tools used in the course have been:

1.  Laptop: one for each student and one with video projector for teachers.

2.  smarth phones used as cameras.

3.  Gmail. Almost all students have a gmail address, but few of them are able to use it. Gmail have been use to communicate between teachers and students and beteween students. At the end of the project students were students were more aware of the gmail potential; they had possibility to practice with a tool already widely used in workplaces.

4.  Google Drive. Tool used to share project documents. Almost all activities have been carried out using Google Drive working on line and producing documents in electronic format. Only final object have been printed in paper format.

> At beginning, no students knew Google Drive.
>
> Type of Documents used:

-   Texts editor

-   Drawing editor

**Schedule and working phases**

Working process have been a duration of 20 hours lessons organized in 4 phases as per flow chart shown below.

Dashed box and links refer to phases 5 and 6 projected but not implemented because of the limited time available.

Activities have been carried out in class room and in cooking laboratory.

Below are briefly described the activities for each phase.

**Start**

Duration: 3 hours (in addition to twenty hours of project)

-   Check of Google Account and Gmail address for each student.

-   Creation and check of mailing list.

**Phase 1**

Duration of Phase 1: 6 hours

-   Brainstorming (1 hour)

    -   Object definition: “Guide for Combi Oven-Convention Steamer” and activities to be done.

    -   The result of Brainstorming have been to split the “Oven” in 4 sub-objects or areas of investigation:

    -   Input/Output: what comes in and what comes out both in terms of process and auxiliary services;

    -   Types of Oven and its components (electrical, gas, with or without boiler, etc..);

    -   Operating Modes (Convention, Steamer, Mixed, Regeneration, Thermostated steam, Soft cooking, Cook & Hold, etc..)

    -   Maintenance, Cleaning, Hhygiene and Safety.

-   Template for students logbook (2 hours)

> Template was agreed by the two teachers and was submitted to students; they used it before in paper format and after in electronic format on Google Drive.

-   Workgroups and roles (1 hours)

    -   Students have been divided into four working groups (Input/Output, Types of Oven and components, Operating Mode, Maintenance/Cleaning/Hhygiene and Safety) each of them consists of four pupils with a specific role (Communicator, Researcher, Linguist, Technician).

    -   The objective of rules was to empower students in activities.

    -   The roles did not give the expected results because students needed to be guided step by step in their activities.

-   practice exercises with Google Drive (2 hours).

    -   Activities: to create or modify folders, text and drawing files; to give comments on text and drawing files.

    -   Exercises have been “on the job” because documents were useful to build the “Guide of the oven”.

**Phase 2**

Duration of Phase 2: 6 hours

-   Workgroups to realize the “Guide” in draft form.

-   Main Activities:

    -   to read document provided by the teachers;

    -   web quest through key words and creation of document list;

    -   document analysis (both provided by teachers and found by students);

    -   documents synthesis with creation of the guide in draft by sections.

    -   evaluation by teachers.
        > Evaluation criteria are described in below section “Student evaluation”.

**Phase 3**

Duration of Phase 3: 6 hours

-   Workgroups to realize the “Guide” in first emission.

-   Main Activities:

    -   Photographic surveys and visual check on the oven up and running at kitchen laboratory;

    -   Image and text processing; building of different sections of the guide;

    -   Guide printing on two papers in A3 format;

For image processing activities students have chosen autonomy software Pizapp and have implemented a knowledge and skills transfer among peers.

**Phase 4**

Duration of Phase 4: 2 hours

-   Presentation of Workgroups and evaluation by teachers.

-   Main Activities:

    -   Each group presented Workgroup to the teachers and to the whole class.
        > Presentation contents:

<!-- -->

-   Description of its own section of the Guide;

-   Description of process of work with reference to the analysis and synthesis of activities done;

-   Underline of links between different workgroups;

-   Underline of physics contents (temperature, steam, heat transfer and energy transformations)

> Students had freedom to organize themselves in appropriate ways for presentation and the breakdown of topics within the group itself.
>
> For this activity pupils were driven by teachers by questions with function of the lineup in exposure.

-   Guide printing in first emission (Rev. 0).

-   Evaluation by teachers (projected but not realized).
    > Evaluation criteria are described in below section “Student evaluation”.

**End**

-   Final version Guide delivery to customer (kitchen laboratory of the institute) within an event attended by teachers and students.

Below are described Phases 5 and 6 because they can be a guideline for those who want to experiment a similar project.

**Phase 5** (projected but not realized)

Duration of Phase 5: 2 hours

-   Object review involving teachers of kitchen laboratory.

-   Main Activities:

    -   Each Workgroup shows its own section of Guide (first emission Rev. 0) at kitchen laboratory teachers (one of the users of the Guide).

    -   Kitchen laboratory teachers comment the object by checking especially functionality in term of didactic.

    -   Students interact with teachers (kitchen, physics, Italian) providing explanations or acknowledging the comments that will be implemented in the next revision.

    -   Coherence analysis: students and teachers reflect on the product made as a whole with the aim of making the 4 sections consistent with each other (non-redundant information, homogeneous language, missing information, etc ..).

    -   Comments came out from coherence analysis activity will be recorded by each workgroup of student in paper or electronic (drive) format.

**Phase 6** (projected but not realized)

Duration of Phase 6: 4 hours

-   Implementation of comments (came out from phase 5) applying Jigsaw model through disassembling and reassembling of workgroups.

-   Main Activities:

    -   New workgroups formation.
        > Each Workgroup consists of four students each one coming from a different previous group.

    -   Comments implementation.
        > The new four workgroups have the aim to implement the comments and realize the whole Guide.

    -   Guide printing in second emission (Rev. 1).

Cycle implemented in Phases 5 and 6 may reiterate once again: the 4 guides Rev.1 are presented by the students to the teachers of the kitchen laboratory who choose the "best" from their point of view (end user).

Any comments on the selected version of the guide will be implemented by the only group that has carried out; at the end of this guide will be printed in the final emission (Rev2).

Phases 5 and 6 could be implemented also in following school year in the new first class by an handover second class (ex first class previous school year) and first class.

following school year (2014/15): handover between second class (ex first class previous school year) and first class.

**Student evaluation**

Student evaluation criteria:

-   Group work activities: engagement, initiative and leadership, autonomy;

-   Group work presentation: autonomy in subdivision of tasks between members of group;

-   Clarity and autonomy in the exposition; properly use of Italian language;

-   Appropriate use of language-specific technical and scientific;

-   Ability to make connections between the work of different groups (Areas of investigation)

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

The main success have been the **Student Satisfaction** manifested through the motivation during the activities but especially at the end of the course when they were able to “see and touch” the object realized.

**Main Strengths** related to the **methodologies** used have been following:

-   Students implemented and developed skills related to collaborative works.

-   Teachers were focusing more on cooperation and active roles of the students.

-   Strong motivation of the students to interact with the teacher.

-   The valorization of the best students for commitment and profit.

-   The recovery of the motivation to study of some students usually passive or source of disturbance.

**Main Weaknesses** related to **methodologies** used have been following:

-   School attendance discontinuous of several students has created difficulties in group work especially in relation to individual tasks assigned and to be performed in order to finalize the overall group activities.

-   Activities slowed down due to the lack of tools to continue working at home.

-   Hard work for teachers especially at the beginning of the experimentation because it was necessary to reprogram the activities based on students' responses (flexible roles to promote personal attitudes).

**Main Strengths** related to the **Tools and Technologies** used have been following:

-   Technology at beginning was a tool to be learned, at the end it became a tool to perform collaborative activities.

-   Tools and Technologies improved participation and the students' attention to the activities, and also stimulated the creativity to solve problems collaboratively.

-   Technologies helped students to develop the ability to make decisions themselves (for example the choose of piZap software for image processing activities).

**Main Weaknesses** related to **Tools and Technologies** used have been following:

-   Technical problems have slowed activities and were pretext for distraction from the goals (trouble connecting to the wireless network, efficiency of the notebook batteries,..).

-   The poor basic skills in the use of technologies and basic software by some students often creates the need to train the use of the technologies themselves.

In the future we intend to develop the Guide as “Video tutorial” with a new first class during the current school year. We intend to increase the period of experimentation from two to three months (see A.nnex: Comparing Experimentation).

An improvement of this experimentation was already done during subsequent school year 2014/2015.

Analogies and differences between the two experiences (first and second experimentation) are shown in Annex “Comparing First/Second experimentations: Analogies and differences":
