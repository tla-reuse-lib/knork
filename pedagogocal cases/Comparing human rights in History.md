**Pedagogical case: Comparing the idea of human rights in various historical declarations (History, Upper Secondary School)**

**The educational problem**

For students, it is difficult in integrate the topic of human rights taught in history to other subjects in which human rights are also studied. In addition, students should learn collaborative practices while learning history.

**The solution**

This history case was part of a larger project of human rights in an upper secondary school. Several courses (representing various subjects) were integrated: History (this case), Social studies, English language, Geography, Religion (ethics), Media studies, and Philosophy. These courses were conducted at the same phase in April-May before the summer break, lasting seven weeks. During each course, the teaching of the topic and integration with other subjects was organised so that it matched with the aims of the course. At the beginning of the courses, almost all students followed an introductory lesson about human rights, which was given by an external expert from the United Nations association of Finland.

For the history project, the teacher had organised assignments for group works before the course started; the aim was to seek for answers to the question about how the human rights have come true during the various phases in history. Students used, altogether, three lessons (75 minutes each) for doing the group work. Groups used Google Sites as an environment into which they produced their work; each group had a virtual page for their use. The teacher had formed groups of 3 to 4 students. During the lessons, the teacher guided the groups both with the content and with the process of the group work (e.g. “someone takes the first initiative about how to start the work”).

**Key experiences**

Google Sites worked well as a collaborative tool, and the groups, in general, managed to complete their assignments. Students learned the idea of human rights better than during previous courses which were conducted without this kind of group work. However, the assignments were probably too large for the time given. The integration of subjects with other courses did not succeed well enough because all groups got their assignments ready only at the end of the course and there was not any more time for reflecting on and combining the results with the results of the other courses.

**Implementing the trialogical design principles**

**DP1: Organizing activities around shared objects**

Every group had a collaborative assignment to produce material to a larger entity of human rights about various historical declarations.

**DP2: Supporting integration of personal and collective agency and work**

Students worked in groups. Personal agency was not emphasized. Teacher supported group work by giving advice about how to organise and conduct the work in groups.

**DP3: Emphasizing development and creativity through knowledge transformations and reflection**

The teacher created connections between the past and the present times in the assignments, and he provided various types of information sources. Students, however, had difficulties to integrate various sources (like Wikipedia and the Internet to traditional books).

**DP4: Fostering long-term processes of knowledge advancement**

The blog that was created together between several courses can and will be used later on in other lessons by the teachers.

**DP5: Promoting cross-fertilization of knowledge practices and artifacts across communities**

The introductory lesson by an external expert gave a view to human rights in the world from the point of view of United Nations.

**DP6: Providing flexible tools for developing artifacts and practices**

Students used Google Sites as a collaborative working environment, and every group had its own page for the work. Everyone could see the work of others but the groups could edit only their own page. In addition, students had access to a blog about human rights but they did not use it during this entity.
