**Pedagogical case: Computer Aided Design in Electronics (Analog and Digital Circuits Design, Upper Secondary Level Technical School)**

**Author(s)**: Senior assistant Stela Stefanova Ph.D., Radostina Gercheva M.Sc.

**Affiliation(s)**: Technology school “Electronic Systems” (TUES) associated with Technical University of Sofia (TUS)

**Date of publication**: March 14, 2015

**The educational problem**

The educational problems were:

1. To increase the interest and motivation of students:

2. To meet the requirements of modern professional education for:

-   Improvement of students’ practical skills;

-   Group work on common projects;

-   Responsibilities allocation for the execution of the common tasks;

-   Creating skills in students to define their own timetable in order to meet specified deadline.

The problem was how to reorganize the Computer Aided Design course in order to:

-   achieve practice oriented education during the school year,

-   to obtain knowledge in the fields of schematics and printed circuit design, analog and digital circuit simulation,

-   obtain better students’ learning outcomes,

**The solution**

In order to achieve these objectives and resolve problems a new trialogical educational approach was introduced with

-   Using cloud computing technologies,

-   Up-to-date communication tools for student-teacher connection

-   Continuous monitoring and assistance students’ activities

Trialogical approach was used to address

-   Team work on shared object (report)

-   Continuous and prolonged work (within 2 weeks) before the laboratory work.

-   Strengthening the tasks of circuit design using devices’ data sheets and simulation of the circuits, calculations of circuit’s currents and parameters

-   Continuous monitoring and teacher assistance in this process, providing help on request

-   Reporting on the individual contribution of each team member to the overall project

-   Respect to meet the deadline (after the prescribed date the project is locked for editing)

**Key experiences**

The pilots were conducted with two classes of 52 students – 11 grade classes (15 weeks). In addition to the project work, students were required to submit seven individual homework assignments. Each team had to choose a project subject from a list provided by the teacher.

All participants had to register individual Google accounts. The teacher was responsible for creating a Google Docs document for each project report and sharing it with the team.

The key successes were:

-   Developing collaboration skills in students;

-   making use of project based learning;

-   using problem solving as a teaching tool;

-   using modern cloud technologies as shared environment for collaboration during this course with timely, appropriate and detailed feedback and reflection;

-   It is collaborative in nature and uses enabling and empowering technologies;

-   It fosters Contextual learning bridging the disciplines and curriculum areas.

-   Work efficiently as a group,

-   Manage their work in terms of tasks and time distribution for achieving deadlines;

-   Present and report their work considering the problems they face.

-   Hold and evaluate, discuss and justify the proposed solutions.

-   Make peer reviews and comment results

**Preparations before the course**

Before the course starts these steps have to be accomplished:

-   Formation of the student teams

-   Collection of the Gmail accounts of all students

-   Development of documentation templates with tasks to be done

-   Creation of Google Group for each class

-   Create folders for the groups and workspaces

-   Upload learning material

-   Create project development agenda

-   Find and prepare projects for the groups to work on

**ICT tool(s)**

-   SPICE, Orcad and other CAD tools for circuit design

-   Google Doc, Google Application, Google Drive,

**Student evaluation**

The CAD in Electronics course in TUES is project oriented. Working in teams of 2 persons, the students are required to design and simulate digital and analog circuit.

The students have to do weekly assignments, developed collaboratively–shared presentations in the field of Analog and Digital circuits design and simulation. These homework activities will be presented, discussed and analyzed in class and uploaded in Google Drive and Google Site of CAD Course.

The long term projects will be developed from groups of 2 students. They have to gather information, discuss the given problem in collaborative environment, analyze and simulate the digital or analog circuit using dedicated CAD software – Cadence Orcad Capture and PSpice.

The students will have to document their work at every step of the development process and to upload in Google Drive project space. In the end of the two month long term project students will have to present their solution of the given project.

Most of development takes place outside the regular classes. For their intra-team communication, the students are free to choose whatever tools they prefer (chat, conferencing, email). For student - teacher communications we decide to use the Google tools: Groups, Gmail, Docs, Talk, Calendar, Drive and Google+. Students were encouraged to submit their questions as emails instead of chat messages.

Students’ knowledge is evaluated continuously during the semester and by final exam test. The shared report grade is based on next criteria: material/organization, presentation, depth of material, handling of questions, solving problems and conclusion on simulation and measurement results. Commenting activities and communications between students - teachers are also appreciated.

Six quizzes (20 minutes each) will be given periodically in lecture class throughout the semester. These are intended to gauge the student's understanding of the basic concepts covered in the course, and hence will not require extensive numerical calculations (i.e. calculators should not be needed).

Two one-hour assessments at the mid and the end of the semester with test questions from laboratory exercises and the final one-hour exam test covering the whole material are performed. All quizzes and tests are closed book, with a limited number of pages of notes allowed.

The final grades are separated for the theory and the practice, which are based on the students’ outcomes. The grade for practice skills is formed from: weekly assignments - 50%, student projects – 30%, practice exams – 20%. The grade for theoretical knowledge is based on: exam tests - 60%, spoken exam - 40%.

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

***Experiences***

1.  Students’ work in a collaborative environment with shared documents.

2.  Experience in the use of modern cloud technology.

3.  Experience in the restructuring of the course content.

4.  Creation of a web-based CAD course platform.

***Suggestions for improvements***

1.  Optimal distribution of students in groups. Not only according to their desire.

2.  Criteria for evaluation of responsibilities in teams, according to the complexity of the project.

3.  Update the criteria for the assessment of current tasks and defining the severity of these criteria in forming the final course grade of the individual team members.
