**The educational problem**

The first upper secondary school courses of Physics, Chemistry and Biology are full of fragmented information and there is no time to expand them into an integrated whole. Energy is discussed in all courses, but from different viewpoints.

**The solution**

The solution was to examine one topic, that is common in all courses (energy), as an integrated phenomenon from the perspective of all domains.

First the students had a joint brainstorming session about phenomena that interested them in the topic ‘Energy in the ecosystem’. To promote brainstorming, the joint session included the barbecuing of sausages in the school courtyard. Students formed groups that had the task of creating materials about the phenomenon they had chosen to examine. All materials of the groups were combined into a larger entity to be used as study material in future courses of the school. An expert from a solar power company participated in the process by giving an expert lecture to the students. Open cloud services such as Google document and Padlet were used for sharing and co-authoring all versions of the material, and the final product is constructed with Prezi.

**Key experiences**

In the students’ answers to the open questions in the post-questionnaire, The most often mentioned positive issues were learning new content and skills, and collaboration in groups. The main challenges were related to information processing and group work.

Teachers’ collaboration succeeded well; in general, the large entity and the structure of the course was good, and furthermore, the use of digital technology succeeded well. Teachers felt that it is important that the new practices were successfully used for improving obligatory courses and for a large group of students, not only to small voluntary courses with especially motivated students.

However, the teachers didn’t have much time to plan the processes well enough till the end of the process. For that reason they felt that the end was somewhat disintegrated. In addition, the intended collaboration and integration between the courses was too limited, similarly the use of the external expert.

| DP1: Organising activities around shared objects                                             | Students write texts about different topics of energy in the groups of 3 to 4 students. The topics are chosen based on the brainstorming in the first lesson. The students read and evaluate each others’ products in the middle of the project, and define new goals based on that. The compressed textual products will be combined into a larger entity, e.g. Prezi-presentation.                                                                                                                                                  |
| DP2: Supporting integration of personal and collective agency and work                       | Grouping: in the first lesson, the students are gathered in the school courtyard, where they fry sausages and discuss about the energy sources of nature and the transformation of energy from one form to another. Students brainstorm about issues and questions related to the topic and record them as voice or video files. After that the created ideas were collected into a shared wall, and they were together grouped by topics. Students were divided into groups that chose a topic which they investigated more closely. |
| DP3: Emphasizing development and creativity through knowledge transformations and reflection | Groups of 3 to 4 students plan their own working; they discuss what issues their topic included as well as sharing of responsibilities in writing and commenting. The groups write their part in a common Google-document; therefore all groups see what others are doing. The teacher guides the groups’ writing both virtually and during f2f lessons. The groups comment on the text of another group at the middle of the project. Comments are asked also from an external expert.                                               |
| DP4: Fostering long-term processes of knowledge advancement                                  | Student groups improve their own product based on the comments that they receive from another group at the middle of the project. Those groups that have a same theme, construct a joint presentation at the end. All products of all groups are compiled as a common digital material. Students of future courses will be used this material as a source of information.                                                                                                                                                             |
| DP5: Promoting cross-fertilization of knowledge practices and artifacts across communities   | A solar energy expert from a Finnish company keeps a lecture about using solar energy in Finland and abroad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| DP6: Providing flexible tools for developing artifacts and practices                         | During group work: Padlet for brainstorming, Google Drive tools for text authoring.
