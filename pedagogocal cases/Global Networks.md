**Pedagogical case: Global Networks (Global Networks; Upper Secondary Level Technology School)**

**Author(s)**: Senior assistant Ph.D Stela Stefanova, M. Sc. Radostina Gercheva

**Affiliation(s)**: Technology school “Electronic Systems” (TUES) associated with Technical-University of Sofia (TUS)

**Date of publication**: January 7, 2016

**The educational problem**

The educational problems were:

1. To gain the contribution and motivation of students;

2. To meet the demands of contemporary professional education for:

-   betterment of students’ practical abilities;

-   team work on common assignments;

-   liabilities allocation for the fulfillment of the common tasks;

-   form skills, in students, to assign their own timetable in order to handle specified deadline.

The problem was how to rearrange the Global Networks course in order to:

-   reach practice oriented training during the two school terms,

-   to acquire knowledge in the domain of global networks, networking protocols and technologies,

-   gain better students’ learning achievements.

**The solution**

A specialized course in the field of Global Networks, giving the students the opportunity to obtain:

-   practical knowledge in networking;

-   ability to use up-to-date professional tools, services and equipment to design networks;

-   skills in teamwork;

-   knowledge in how to manage their work in terms of tasks and time distribution for fulfilling deadlines;

-   ability to present and report their work, considering the problems they face and how they are resolved, or why these problems cannot be resolved.

The practical training of the students in the Global Networks course consists of two major projects during the term, which are made on weekly basis.

**Key experiences**

The pilots were made with two classes each of them with 29 students – 12 grade classes (15 weeks). The project work was divided to be fulfilled step-by-step with submitting six individual homework assignments, each of these assignments was small part of the project. Each group had to choose theme for the project from a list, provided by the teacher.

All participants had to register individual Google accounts. The teacher was responsible to create a Google Drive folder for each project and share it with the team.

The key successes were:

-   Improving collaboration skills in students;

-   Deployment project based learning;

-   using research and problem solving as a educational tools;

-   using contemporary cloud technologies as common environment for cooperation during this course with well-timed, adequate and comprehensive feedback and remark;

-   It is collaboration-based and uses enabling and empowering technologies;

-   It fosters Contextual learning bridging the disciplines and curriculum areas.

**Implementing the trialogical design principles**

DP1: Organising activities around shared objects

Teams organization (students will have the ability to choose their teams by yourself).

Collaborative development of common project, and preparation of shared

Task distribution between the members of a team.

Activities: regular meetings for discussion of project tasks and preliminary review of the used tools and the progress of the project development.

DP2: Supporting integration of personal and collective agency and work

Coordinating participants – team members will choose the partners they want to work with.

Motivating students to distribute tasks between team members take the responsibility for the project deadline.

Collective responsibility - in the group each member takes the responsibility for their project tasks.

DP3: Emphasizing development and creativity through knowledge transformations and reflection

Discussion and analysis of problems the teams faced during their collective work on the common project.

Thoughtfully and creatively establish, conduct and operate the project development.

Practice already gained knowledge and skills in using dedicated networking equipment to solve the tasks of the project.

DP4: Fostering long-term processes of knowledge advancement

Prolonged working process with iterative network configuration – performing number of analysis of the designed network to refine the network parameters and characteristics.

Planning and writing the documentation, sharing the drafts, asking the teacher and other students for feedback, improving the project and project documentation, submitting respective report and presenting the obtained design and simulation results.

Using forums, blogs and social media for discussing problems and talk about their points of view and opinions.

DP5: Promoting cross-fertilization of knowledge practices and artifacts across communities

Students contribute with specialists from the ICT industry.

Industry professionals, teachers and students discuss and analyze collaborative experience.

Students use modern professional tools in order to plan, organize, and execute the project tasks and write project documentation.

DP6: Providing flexible tools for developing artifacts and practices

Face to face and virtual meetings (Skype).

Share materials/comment easily - Google Apps.

Google Docs for collaborative editing and commenting. Google Drive for file sharing. Google+ for discussions.

As alternative a CMS based site might be a suitable solution.

Project management – Google Apps.

The Google Calendar is very useful for project scheduling - related events by sending RSVP invitations.

**Student evaluation**

The Global Networks course in TUES is project oriented. Working in teams of 2 students, who are required to do research and make presentation for a certain topics in the field of networking.

The students have to do research and step-by-step develop presentations as weekly assignments, the final stage of the project are the complete collaboratively–developed presentations in the field of Global Networks. These homework tasks are presented, discussed and analyzed in class and uploaded in Google Drive and Google Site of Global Networks Course.

The students have to gather information, discuss the given problems in collaborative environment, analyze and design presentation which covers all aspects of a given topic in the field of networking.

The students document their work at every step of the development process and to upload in Google Drive space. In the end of the two one month long projects students have to present their topics in the domain of Global Networks.

The project development takes place outside the regular classes. For their intra-group communication, the students are free to use any tools they like (chat, conferencing, email). For student - teacher communications the following Google tools are used: Groups, Gmail, Docs, Talk, Calendar, Drive and Google+. Students are fostered to file their questions as emails instead of chat messages.

Students’ skills are evaluated constantly during the semester, by final exam test and practical exams. The common report grade is based on next criteria: research, presentation, depth of material, handling of questions, solving problems and well-spread timing. Commenting activities and discussions between students and teachers are also appreciated.

Two quizzes (20 minutes each) are given periodically in lecture class throughout the semester. These are intended to evaluate the student's knowledge of the basic concepts covered in the course.

Two one-hour practical assessments, with questions from laboratory exercises - covering the whole material, are performed. All quizzes and tests are closed book, with a limited number of pages of notes allowed.

The final grades are based on the students’ outcomes. The grade is formed as follows: research – 10%, student presentation projects – 35%, spoken presentation exams – 30%, well-spread timing according deadline – 5%, exam tests – 20%.

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

***Experiences***

1.  Students’ work in a collaborative environment with shared documents.

2.  Experience in the use of modern cloud technology.

3.  Experience in the rearrangement of the course content.

4.  Creation of a web-based Global Networks course platform.

***Suggestions for improvements***

1.  Optimal distribution of students in groups. Not only according to their desire.

2.  Criteria for evaluation of responsibilities in teams, according to the complexity of the project.

3.  Update the criteria for the assessment of current tasks and defining the severity of these criteria in forming the final course grade of the individual team members.
