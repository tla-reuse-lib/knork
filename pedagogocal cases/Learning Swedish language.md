**The educational problem**

There were three education problems to be solved:

1.  For upper secondary students, the content (the vocabulary of environmental issues in Swedish language) is difficult to learn.

2.  Integration of disciplines is strongly needed and encouraged

3.  It is necessary to teach work life competencies, such as collaborative learning and information processing.

**The solution**

The solution was to start from the theme, environmental issues, and use language as a tool. A concrete solution was to apply inquiry learning so that through collaborative learning, students get familiar with a demanding vocabulary. All students made a small study in groups of 2-4 participants in the language to be studied (Swedish) about “Sustainable development”, which was the theme of the course in the curriculum. The course duration was 6 weeks (an ordinary duration of the courses).

**Key experiences**

*Students’ experiences*: Doing an own study was authentic use of language and a meaningful way of learning the vocabulary and the theme. Students had learned also about making a study and collaborative work. In the end of the project students presented their studies and they felt that they were the experts of their own theme. Groups were very interested in knowing what the other groups had done.

*Teachers’ experiences*: Teachers have conducted the project now for 4 times (altogether) and they both regard the process very relevant. Students have learned collaborative work, doing a study and vocabulary embedded in the project. The next step is to improve the language learning more and more. Students have felt ownership of their work and they have been very enthusiastic about their presentations.

| DP1: Organising activities around shared objects                                             | Groups worked with their own study; the outcomes were open to all students. A shared content for all students was the vocabulary of environmental issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| DP2: Supporting integration of personal and collective agency and work                       | Students worked in groups. Personal agency was not emphasized. A collective agency was created through the strong commitment during the study project. Leadership of the study group changed every week which helped to create commitment of each member.                                                                                                          |
| DP3: Emphasizing development and creativity through knowledge transformations and reflection | The process of creating the study had various sub activities (concentrated on the vocabulary of the content) which helped to create also the study. Students, e.g., made a Kahoot-test about the vocabulary to others, they evaluated other group’s study and got feedback from the teacher and from other students, and the process itself had reflective phases. |
| DP4: Fostering long-term processes of knowledge advancement                                  | The process itself was longitudinal and lasted 6 weeks (the duration of the course). Developing language competence builds on previous competence and the learned is used later on in studies.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| DP5: Promoting cross-fertilization of knowledge practices and artifacts across communities   | No special external cross-fertilization was included but students used authentic sources for their study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| DP6: Providing flexible tools for developing artifacts and practices                         | Several collaborative tools were used. The studies were available to all students in school’s learning environment (Fronter), various applications were used for reporting, free and open tools, like Todaysmeet, Kahoot, Quizlet, were used during the process. The tools were mainly used so that students created activities with them, less teacher-centered.  |

**Detailed description of the pedagogical implementation**

**Background information**

Educational level: Upper secondary school

Topic: Course Sustainable development

Subject domain(s): Swedish

Duration: 6 weeks

**Learning goals**

The aim is to learn Swedish language, focusing on the vocabulary of environmental issues (named as Sustainable development), and to learn a small-scale project work, connected to real life and working life. In addition the students had to negotiate throughout the project who was in charge and how the tasks would be distributed and reported, thus getting more practice in real-life collaboration.

**Preparations before the course**

The participating teachers teach Swedish language in two separate upper secondary schools and they planned the process together, in two workshops and also virtually just before the course phase started. They also met prior to starting the course to write the course outline together, decide on deadlines and tasks. The courses ran at the same phase (5. phase). They also evaluated the process afterwards.

**ICT tool(s)**

Fronter, a closed virtual learning environment which supports sharing various types of materials, commenting, and collecting all documents into one place. For the study reporting, students used such applications which were relevant for them (e.g. Word, Excel, PowerPoint). In Olari, students used iPads (applications such as Pages, Numbers) and conducted surveys by using, for example, Facebook as a contact platform. In Tapiola, the students used Windows RT tablet computers and various applications and platforms to make the graphics of the study and to exchange ideas with each other.

In addition, small cloud service applications were used for various assignments (Quizlet and Kahoot for testing vocabulary, Padlet and Todaysmeet for evaluation).

**Schedule and working phases**

The study project is carried out during an ordinary course, as one part of it. The course is the last obligatory course for students and for this reason, there is a lot of pressure for the course and the content. Students worked with the study once a week about 30 mins during 6 weeks (e.g. in Olari, the study was conducted every Friday about 40 mins). Students used also extra time outside the school. After every working session in school they reported the progress in Fronter. All materials, links, plans, timetable etc. were available in Fronter

***The main phases of the working process***

1.  The project was started with a presentation at the beginning of the course and planning in groups. The students together with the teacher decided the topic, the outline and a preliminary timetable. Teacher commented the plans.

2.  During the second week, the final study plan was put into Fronter. Decisions of leading responsibilities during the following weeks 3-6. Everyone was expected to lead at least one week depending on the size of the group. After second session in school, students commented on at least one other group’s work at home.

3.  Working with the vocabulary: students did Quizlet- and Kahoot-tasks to other students (these were used at the beginning of the next lesson). Timetable planning for the empirical part of the study, teacher comments (in Swedish).

4.  Every group made a study (e.g. interview questions, questionnaire, manuscript for a video interview/questions). The empirical part was conducted outside school (except if they interviewed other students etc.) and this was mainly done in Swedish.

5.  Working with the project, collecting data, writing a research report.

6.  Finalising, presentations. The final work / presentation: main part written in Swedish. Short commenting other group’s work in Fronter or with Padlet or Todaysmeet.

***Performance criteria, student assessment and evaluation practices***

Teachers gave students the following template for the study:

> *In the report you have to have the following issues:*

-   *The aim or the starting point of the study*

-   *A description of the methods (how the study was conducted, questions or questionnaires etc.)*

-   *Results described in an illustrative way. Also summed up in one sentence to be used in a publication.*

-   *After the study, a self-reflection about the success of the study, group working process and participation of the members and the distribution of the work in the group.*

Teachers evaluated the following aspects: progressing the study (outcomes in Fronter), the vocabulary of the final report (the appropriateness and the richness of the vocabulary, the content of the study, the working process of the group and participation), oral presentation in Swedish (fluency, vocabulary, intonation, word stress).

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

***What worked well? What did not work so well? How could the solution be improved?***

-   In general, the projects succeeded well, and both the teachers and students liked it and saw the benefits for future studies and work life (once one student complained that the study project took time from “ordinary” way to learn all the chapters in book).

<!-- -->

-   For teachers, the lack of time was a problem. There was not enough time for the final presentations and reporting, and especially for a final joint discussion. In addition, in the next time more emphasis should be put also in the language learning and integrating vocabulary and grammar (if desired) tasks.

-   Students’ studies should be outlined better (to avoid too demanding studies), also the study task for students should be more finalised.

***Students’ feedback***

*“I liked the assignment. It made possible to use Swedish more freely, create own sentences and questions so challenging as one wanted. It was interesting and fun to ask other students and see their answers.”*

*“All worked in a fair way except of some absence (and due to that, not participating). We kept the timetable and everyone did the agreed parts well. We worked both in class and outside the school during our leisure time, and these both succeeded well.”*

*“I learned new vocabulary and also various grammar topics . While speaking, thinking and interviewing speaking Swedish became more fluent. When collaborating with the group I learned to know new people which was nice.”*

*“Project work was nice and there should be more of them in school. All kinds of surveys and other project in which you use opinions and manners of young people of same age are interesting and it is possible to learn of them. For instance, if, while doing a study, one notice that a young person in the same school reads several newspapers and journals and probably even in Swedish, one can her/him self also start reading more and learn something new and useful.”*

*“The collaboration worked really well and all did the tasks equally much, although all were not present in every lesson. In a group, it was easy to listen others and tell own opinions because all participants were taken into account. The assignment was done in time because we stayed also a few time after school to work and iterate the assignment. Project was useful because we learned in a fun way in the group and not only by reading in a book. Project was also versatile and interesting because we could choose an interesting topic together in the group.”*

*“I learned the difficulty of Swedish language.”*
