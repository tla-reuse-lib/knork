*The Re-use Library *

**Pedagogical case**: **Semiconductor Devices (Electronics, Technical University)**

**Author(s)**: Tania Vasileva & Vassiliy Tchoumatchenko

**Affiliation(s)**: Technical University of Sofia

**Date of publication**: March 23, 2015

**The educational problem**

The educational challenge was

> 1. To increase the commitment and motivation of students
>
> 2. To meet the requirements of business for:

-   Better practical training;

-   Team work on common task;

-   Shared responsibility for the quality of the overall product;

-   Distribution of tasks in line with the specified deadline.

The problem was how to restructure the Semiconductor Devices course in order to:

-   Obtain better students’ knowledge and competencies,

-   Obtain better systematic training during the semester,

-   Stimulate circuit design and simulation for project verification,

-   Transfer the initiative towards student-teacher direction.

**The solution**

In order to achieve these objectives and resolve problems a new trialogical educational approach was introduced with

-   Using cloud computing technologies,

-   Up-to-date communication tools for student-teacher connection

-   Continuous monitoring and assistance students’ activities

Trialogical approach was used to address

-   Team work on shared object (report)

-   Continuous and prolonged work (within 2 weeks) before the laboratory work.

-   Strengthening the tasks of circuit design using devices’ data sheets and simulation of the circuits, calculations of circuit’s currents and parameters

-   Continuous monitoring and teacher assistance in this process, providing help on request

-   Reporting on the individual contribution of each team member to the overall project

-   Respect to meet the deadline (after the prescribed date the project is locked for editing)

**Key experiences**

Introducing new technologies and paradigms in established engineering courses is always challenging. In addition to the core subject matter, students had to learn and use advanced tools for collaboration and communication in the network. The majority of students showed more interest and were more motivated to work in teams on a common report. The immediacy of help provided via email, compared to the scheduled face to face meeting, was considered as very positive. In a whole, it has been a rewarding experience for both students and teachers.

**Detailed description of the pedagogical implementation**

**Background information**

Educational level: Bachelor degree (3<sup>rd</sup> semester)

Topic: Semiconductor devices (compulsory course)

Subject domain(s): Electronics

Duration: 15 weeks

**Learning goals**

The main topics of the Semiconductor Devices course concern: Introduction to Semiconductors, PN Junction Diodes, Schotcky Diodes, BJTs, MOSFETs, JFETs, Optoelectronic Elements, Introduction to Integrated Circuit, Displays

At the end of the course the students are expected to have knowledge on principle of basic semiconductors devices, to know their characteristics, mode of operation and influence of temperature on their parameters, to understand the physical limits of operation (avalanche and zener breakdown, punch-through, self-heating), to use models of semiconductor devices to predict terminal characteristics under diverse operating conditions, to be able to choose appropriate device for given application, to design and analysis simple circuits with semiconductor devices, to calculate important parameters, and to use devices in solving engineering problems.

**Preparations before the course**

Before the course starts, the following issues are done:

-   Teams’ formation

-   Gmail accounts of all students

-   Development of documentation templates with tasks to be done for all pre-lab project and final report

-   Guidelines for students for practical sessions

-   LTspice tutorial

**ICT tool(s)**

***Cloud & Communication tools***

Google Tools are used for collaborative development of a common shared object in the cloud– Google Drive, Docs, Sheets; *Google calendar* – to set deadlines and to monitor progress – assignments, intermediate stages reporting, deadline for submission of project

For inter team communications students can choose their preferred tools (chat, conferences, e-mail, forums). For student – teacher communications are used Google applications: Gmail, Calendar, Drive и Google+.

Two-week cycle for two practical exercises is used. The main phases in each cycle are:

-   Pre-lab phase (design & analysis tasks – circuit design, parameter calculation, simulation)

-   Face to face session (discussion on common problems, faced by many students, explanation cloud technology and tools used, answering difficult subject questions)

-   Pre-lab tasks continue (design & analysis)

-   Laboratory work (practical measurement)

-   Project finalization (final preparation of shared report including measured data and conclusions)

Students work in groups of 3-4 persons on a shared common report, which is continuously monitored, taking into account the individual contribution of each team member.

***Pre-lab phase*** - The goal is students to be prepared in advance for the properties of the devices, which they will explore during the laboratory session)

*Tasks*: Team collaboratively to develop shared report, which include theoretical questions, design and analysis tasks. A number of problems are assigned to be investigated by simulation.

*Activities:* schematic capture & graphic drawing, calculation of device parameters, circuit design - currents, resistance, parameters, design verification by simulation.

***Face-to-face session*** - The goal is to discuss common instructions and problems, faced by many students

*Activities:* questions & answers, slides & computer presentations

***Lab measurements phase***

*Tasks:* To measure device characteristics, to explore circuit behavior in different conditions

*Activities*: practical work in the laboratory with measurement devices in different mode of operation, temperatures and signal frequencies. All measured data are filled in shared document by using students’ smartphone or computers

***Project finalization***

*Tasks*: finally to complete the shared document to include measurement data

*Activities*: drawing graph of measured data, parameters calculation, resolving problems, making conclusions

**Student evaluation**

Students’ knowledge is evaluated continuously during the semester and by final exam test.

The shared report grade is based on next criteria: material/organization, presentation, depth of material, handling of questions, solving problems and conclusion on simulation and measurement results. Commenting activities and communications between students - teachers are also appreciated.

The final grade will be based on a total of 10% quiz grades, 20% shared reports grades, 20% of midterm tests grades and 50% of final exam test grade.

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

***What worked well?***

-   Greater interest and involvement of the majority of students.

-   Besides their knowledge on the subject students acquire skills to work in a team and to use advanced tools for collaboration and communication in the network.

-   Better preparation for laboratory work – students are acquainted with the problems, with devices’ mode of operation and the characteristics, which they will explore

-   Avoiding the problem of copying reports from one to other and their delivery to the end of the semester (the project is locked after the deadline).

-   Control of the process and the contribution of each participant – notes and comments of the teacher in total shared project during its development in the Google docs’ document.

***What did not work so well?***

-   Difficulties in precise evaluation of personal contribution of each team member to common work

-   Some students complain that part of the team does not work well and do not contribute to the quality of common work,

-   Problems how to force lazy students to work well

-   Extremely heavy-duty of assistants not only in classes but also in the preparation of assignments for individual & shared work and continuous consultations, monitoring and evaluation of projects.

***How would you improve the solution?***

-   We will try to divide role between students in the team and to rotate this roles during the semester

-   We will reward and punish student by bonus points, contributing to their final score

-   We will try to organize students to write individually short weekly note or message in a shared system about their progression (currently not enough clear how to stress not enough active students to participate – probably make students comment on each other’s / other groups work throughout the course)

-   We will try to reduce teaching load minimizing face to face seminars through development of guides how students to use cloud tools and simulation tools.
