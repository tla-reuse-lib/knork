**The educational problem**

In engineering education in the universities of applied sciences, it is important that students learn, in addition to domain contents and professional practices, also social and academic skills such as learning to make systematic exploratory knowledge work, working in groups, explicating one’s ideas to others, or peer evaluation.

**The solution**

The ways of working and nature of tasks in the bachelor level Sensor Technology course was designed to support the practicing and learning of various skills. The students worked collaboratively to create wiki pages around the topic - sensor technology (e.g. how the common sensors work electrically and physically, how to design and verify measurement systems, how to analyze measurement systems, how to optimize signal to noise ratio and analyzed examples of real-life sensors and measurement systems). At the end of the course, the students produced a presentation of another group’s topic in a new group composition and gave the presentations in small groups. Students wrote weekly self-evaluations and commented on other groups’ products several times using Moodle tools. There was natural cross-fertilization in the course because students both from English and Finnish study programs participated in the course.

**Key experiences**

Producing wiki articles was a good assignment; also another student group was able to participate in the knowledge production through a shared wiki site. Moodle’s Workshop tool was useful when the students cross-evaluated each others writings. It is important to keep the structure of the virtual spaces simple enough. The organization of the last seminar as making a presentation from some other group’s article was an interesting experiment; students had to work for common good, not only for their own product. However, the task also received critical comments from students; they would have liked to make presentations from their own theme. There has to be some way to promote cross-fertilization between groups, but the solution needs improvement; perhaps more commenting tasks throughout the course and also face-to-face interaction between students. Also some concrete hands-on work or lab work with sensors should be added in the course. The supervision and guidance of the groups’ progression could be improved.

**Materials and links**

-   Course wiki for students’ articles about Sensor Technology: [*https://wiki.metropolia.fi/display/sensor/Sensor+Technology+Home*](https://wiki.metropolia.fi/display/sensor/Sensor+Technology+Home)

-   Final presentations were made by PowerPoint using the idea of Slidedocs [*http://www.duarte.com/slidedocs/*](http://t.co/WaArMPAdtt)

Some example of the Slidedoc presentation made by students (to be added)

**Implementing the trialogical design principles**

**DP1: Organising activities around shared objects**

Producing content about the topic as wiki articles. The wiki website was a shared objects for the whole course, and each group had their shared object in writing their own articles in wiki. Also the seminar presentations (Slidedocs) were shared objects that were produced and evaluated together in groups.

**DP2: Supporting integration of personal and collective agency and work**

Divide the class into working pairs. Each pair picks up one or two sensors from a list and study them in detail. Students were in a central role in knowledge production. The course tasks were a combination of individual tasks (weekly self-reflection, commenting other group’s work) and group tasks (writing wiki articles).

**DP3: Emphasizing development and creativity through knowledge transformations and reflection**

Reflection was supported systematically by weekly self-evaluation, and peer-evaluation assignments after the production of first wiki pages and the final articles. The teacher structured both the self-evaluation and the peer-evaluation by guiding questions to be answered through Moodle.

**DP4: Fostering long-term processes of knowledge advancement **

The working process during the course was sustained and long-term, because the students worked on their main wiki article throughout the course. Sustainability is also supported by the wiki website, which is supposed to be used, updated and constructed further in future courses.

**DP5: Promoting cross-fertilization of knowledge practices and artifacts across communities**

The participants of the course came both from the international and Finnish study programs. In the last seminar, the groups were mixed and the Finnish students had to communicate more in English. Also another group of students with their teacher from another course participated in writing pages to the same wiki, which was a nice additional cross-fertilization feature in the course. There were no working life contacts or expert guests.

**DP6: Providing flexible tools for developing artifacts and practices**

The main digital tools used in the course were 1) Moodle for sharing instructions and course materials as well as organizing reflective tasks, commenting and discussions; and 2) Confluence Wiki for co-authoring articles about the course topic. The teacher videotaped all course meetings and shared the videos through Moodle, which was a good service for students if they had to be absent from some meeting.

-   PowerPoint for making final presentations using the idea of Slidedocs (see [*http://www.duarte.com/slidedocs/*](http://t.co/WaArMPAdtt)).

**Schedule and working phases**

The work process was divided in weekly themes. The rythm for the class work (three hour meetings) was the following:

-   Intro (15 min), Planning (15 min), Search and Study (60 min) ⇒ 1 ½ hours

-   Mental break (15 min)

-   Continue working (60 min), Wrapping up (15 min), Planning for the individual home work (15 min) ⇒ 1 ½ hours

Detailed description of the course progression is below:

1. *Orientation.* 13.3. - 20.3.2014. 4 h.

Contact teaching. The course contents and working principles were explained to the students. The first assignment was to study the sensor technology markets and write a short article about that. The work was done in small groups. The articles were published in open wiki platfrom. The results are visible at [*https://wiki.metropolia.fi/display/sensor/Sensor+Technology+Home*](https://wiki.metropolia.fi/display/sensor/Sensor+Technology+Home)

2. *Selection of a research topic.* 20.3.-26.3.2014. 8 h.

Partly in contact and distance learning. The students were asked to select a research topic for their team, for example a specific sensor or application where the sensors are used and write a first draft of about that to collaborative wiki.

3. *Reviews and comments on the first draft*. 20.3. - 26.3.2014. 8 h.

Distance learning. The aim was to study what the others have written about and write short comments what was good and what could be improved.

4. *Physical principles of sensing*. 27.3.- 3.4.2014. 8 h.

Contact and independent working. This time the task was to study the physical principles behind the sensors. The aim was to write about the principles to collaborative wiki and explain a couple of most important terms related to their physical principles. The results are visible in collaborative wiki and Moodle platform we are using for sharing.

5. *Sensor characteristics*. 3.4.2014 - 10.4.2014. 8 h.

The teacher gave a short explanatory lecture (15 min) where the terms were opened. Then the teams were asked to study more carefully their sensors and their technical characteristics. Their aim was to improve their articles in collaborative wiki and focus on technical characteristics of sensors.

6. *Interface electronic circuits*. Started 10.4.2014 - Ended 17.4.2014. Contact hours 4 + Personal and team work 4 hours = Total 8 hours.

Short introduction and working in teams. The assignment was to improve the wiki and writing a subchapter on the theme. After completing write a short summary of how much time spent, what have learnt and what was difficult.

7. *Peer review and comments on the 2nd draft*. Started 17.4.2014 - Ended 24.4.2014. Personal and team work 8 hours. No contact hours.

Moodle’s Workshop assignment was tested for peer-evaluation. 5 randomly selected wiki-pages were given for each student for peer-evaluation. The students were asked to grade the wiki-pages by evaluating the following aspects:

1.  The article was well organised and followed a logical order.

2.  The article gave interesting facts and examples.

3.  I could understand what the author(s) was/were writing about.

4.  The article helped me understand the topic better.

5.  Overall I felt that the article was well done.

The following scale was used: Strongly disagree, Disagree, Somewhat agree, Agree , Strongly agree

8. *Sensor materials and technologies*. Starts 24.4.2014 - Ends 1.5.2014. Contact teaching 4 h + Personal and team work 4 h = Total 8 h

We unfolded the peer-review results and continued to new topic. Again the task was to improve the wiki article, but this time the personal assignment was directed to write and share to the common discussion forum about:

-   What materials did you study?

-   What did you learn about the materials?

-   What manufacturing processes did you study?

-   What did you learn about them?

9. *Preparations for final presentation*. 1.5.2014 - 7.5.2014. Personal and team work 8 hours. No contact hours

The students were given task to prepare a presentation of other team’s material. The teams were shuffled and new teams (pairs) formed.

10. *Final workshop*. 8.5.2014. 4 hours.

In this last contact session, the students finalized their Slidedoc-presentations about other team’s material. All students were divided in two groups where students’ presentations were read and discussed in turns. In the end, each student wrote written feedback to some other’s work using a formula in Moodle including guiding questions (Is the material well organized, Did the material give good examples, Do you understand what presenters are talking about?, Did the material help you understand the topic?, Did the presenter answer well to the questions, Overall, was the presentation well done?).

**Student evaluation**

Performance criteria, student assessment and evaluation practices (to be completed).

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

The teacher mentioned the following aspects as successful:

-   The wiki pages made by the students. The teacher created the structure but all content is produced by the students themselves.

-   It was interesting to test some tools of Moodle; e.g. the Workshop tool was useful when the students cross-evaluated each others writings, in addition to working on their own article for almost eight weeks.

-   The usage of technology (Moodle and Confluence wiki) succeeded well; it is important to keep the structure of the virtual spaces simple enough.

-   The organization of the last seminar where students had to make presentation from the article of some other group was an interesting experiment; they had to work for common good, not only for their own product.

The following issues were mentioned by the teacher as unsuccessful or in need of improvement in the next iteration:

-   There could have been better introductory sessions before students’ own work.

-   The organization of the last seminar received critical comments from students; they thought that it was not a good solution to make presentation from some others’ work. There has to be some way to promote cross-fertilization between groups, but the solution needs improvement; perhaps more commenting tasks throughout the course between groups, and also face-to-face interaction so that the students learn to discuss with others in a foreign language.

-   Theoretical content learning goals were achieved well, but students hoped for having some concrete hands-on work or lab work with sensors too.

-   One possible improvement content-wise is to make the topics even more open for students, not structured according to the source book.

-   Guidance and supervision of the groups’ work could be improved somehow; the teacher has to make sure that each group is progressing. Students should get immediate feedback for their tasks; perhaps the number of tasks (weekly self-reflection, writing wiki pages, peer commenting) should be decreased so that the teacher has time to give feedback when it is important.

The teacher hoped that the students learned skills for making “systematic exploratory work”; this could be explicitly defined as one competence in the course goals in the future. Also peer-evaluation was probably new for most students. The teacher himself learned that when using new ways of working, enough time should be reserved for practicing the new skills; you cannot expect that students manage the new practices at once. For instance, peer evaluation should be practiced with an exercise before it is actually used in the real task. All working methods should be structured and guided, and there has to be repeated possibilities to practice and improve the skills. The teacher should not give up if students do not manage well at once, but give more guidance and instructions, and encourage students to go on.
