**The educational problem**

How get students interested on e-Learning. We are referring to students, which are going to be pedagogical or psychological consultants for companies and schools; for most of them, it is initially absolutely not clear how e-Learning can be related and fruitfully exploited in their future careers.

**The solution**

Using the design principles to plan the course allowed me to project activities able to help students developing communicative, collaborative and technical skills that they could see as closely related to their professional future.

**Key experiences**

Students became gradually interested and competent in using many software, online environments and tools able to support knowledge construction. They also learnt how to work collaboratively by using many pedagogical techniques in a blended mode.

In the future, we will probably reconsider the platform hosting the online activities, turning towards a more “social” and friendly one – mainly because of technical issues impacting on the possibility to continue using the current one. We could also revisit some of the implemented activities, for example the Role Taking, by introducing other roles.

**Implementing the trialogical design principles**

**DP1: Organising activities around shared objects**

Students’ final shared object is a grid meant to guide the observation of e-Learning courses. In order to build such an object, I divided the course into 4 modules. Three of them had specific contents and all together covered the content of the course. During each module, students start to build the items connected to the content of the module, which will finally converge in the grid as indicators to be used during the observation of the courses. The last module was totally devoted to assemble the items and finalize the grid. It was also a way to review all the contents so that students having some difficulties in certain module could recover them at this time

**DP2: Supporting integration of personal and collective agency and work**

During each module, I organized 4 groups of 7-8 students. Each time, I selected 8 educational material covering the content of the module. Then, I assigned a different material to each student so that the students of the same group had different material to study and the same material was assigned to - at least -one student of each group. Students had to study individually the material assigned to them, producing a review to be posted online. The reviews were later assessed by the teacher and meant to support the group-mates’ understanding of each material. Furthermore, students were required to discuss their material to their group via web-forum. In this way each group could combine the various pieces of information by finally producing a map-group. This is an adapted version of the Jigsaw Model.

Furthermore, I designed roles connected to the e-Learning profession and students were request to cover these roles in turn. From the second module on each student covered a role. This strategy proved to promote a high participation.

**DP3: Emphasizing development and creativity through knowledge transformations and reflection**

Students had to start from the educational material assigned to produce their individual reviews. Then they had to produce a collaborative map. Finally, they had to transform the theoretical information collected during the modules into a grid meant to practically guide the observation of an online course. Knowledge, therefore, went through several transformations and many phases of discussion during which creative solutions were proposed.

**DP4: Fostering long-term processes of knowledge advancement **

At the end of each module students were required to:

a) contribute to a reflexive forum were they had to report what and how they learnt and what were their own goals for the next module. This is a reflexive practice that once learnt may impact long-term processes

b) fulfill an e-portfolio with their best products of the module. In the last module, they were required to reflect upon their overall learning process and make a list of competences they think they acquired. They were later encouraged to include this list into their CV.

**DP5: Promoting cross-fertilization of knowledge practices and artifacts across communities**

The grid was actually used to analyze various online course. Interaction with experts or managers of these courses were organized. In this way, students could actually be in contact with national and international representatives of the extended scientific community of the e-learning world.

**DP6: Providing flexible tools for developing artifacts and practices**

Many tools were offered: (a) main digital venue was Synergeia; (b) Google drive; (c) several software to build digital maps; (d) Excel; (e ) Active World (f) a software to produce and publish e-books; (g) Webinar; (f) Padelt; (g) email and whatup

**Preparations before the course**

Main issues are: a) Organize the modules (how many and based on what material); b) find and contact the experts to be involved; c) find the suitable software and e-Learning platform.

Sometimes, crucial it is also to find tutors online (from at least 1 to 6, depending on the number of students attending the course). It is important to instruct them about all the theoretical and practical aspects of the course.

**ICT tool(s)**

-   Synergeia: this is an e-Learning platform allowing up-load and download of materials, opening of folders, web-forums, many tools to track students activities and to communicate with them, a whiteboard

-   Google Drive to share documents and build collaboratively texts and maps

-   Power point to present their personal or group products

-   Padlet for brainstorming or , for example, produce a metaphor of the course

-   E-book publisher to produce an e-book

-   Webinar to present group products

-   Active world to have synchronic meetings

**Schedule and working phases**

*First step*: modules and groups. As a start, we propose to: (a) organize the course into modules, each having a different topic; the ensemble of the modules will cover the content of the course; (b) organize the students into groups, ranging from minimum 4 maximum 10 students for each group.

*Second step*: individual profiles. You may propose your students to open personal spaces online. Such spaces could have the nature of e-portfolios, in which students can upload: (a) informal information about themselves in the format of photos, notes, links and anything else they like to post; (b) formal information about their expectations concerning the course, their personal learning goals, the selection of their best objects constructed and activities performed during the course and the competencies they think they have acquired. The fulfillment of the formal section of the individual profiles should be encouraged by the teacher at the end of each module.

*Third step*: lecture, assignment of study material and research question. Each module should have as a starting point a lecture delivered by the teacher face to face. During such introductory lecture the teacher will propose a number of study material corresponding to the number of students forming the groups. For instance, if you formed groups of six students you should have six materials (chapters, articles, PowerPoint presentations, web-sites, etc.) strictly connected to the module and to the lecture. This implies that within the groups formed at the first step, students will study different material and, at the same time, the same material will be studied by as many students as groups. Therefore, if you have formed for instance three groups, three students will have the same study material. Inspired by the Jigsaw method (Aronson, 1978), we will call the groups of students with different material “learning groups” and the group of students having the same material “expert groups”.

The lecture should end by negotiating a challenging and motivating research question. The final aim of the module should be to articulate an answer to such question.

The aim of this step is to support individual participation and, at the same time, the sense of belonging to a group by sharing common goals – namely answering to the research question.

*Fourth step*: the review. An adequate amount of time should be allotted to study the material individually and to prepare a review following a template provided by the teacher (see the appendix). The study material should be posted online and expert groups can discuss the various points of the review template online via web-forum or chat – as they prefer. Once the reviews are ready, a dedicated space should be open online to post the reviews in a word format. At this point, we suggest the teacher to randomly select a few reviews, comment them by using the word-tracking option and insert comments and general assessment, included suggestions about how to improve the reviews. The commented reviews should be posted online and discussed via web-forum.

*Fifth step*: assigning roles. To support active and constructive participation we suggest to develop roles to be assigned individually to students. For instance, leader of the expert group; leader of the learning group; researcher in charge of seeking information to fulfill the points considered as not clear in the learning materials; responsible of the objects that will be constructed during the following step. Further roles can be devoted to ensure the connection between online and offline activities, for instance: responsible of the classroom with the task to take notes during the face to face activities and posting the notes online; or the role of teacher-contact having the task to propose the teacher further lectures about points students want to know more about, raised during the online discussions. These roles should be turned through the modules and students just ending a role can post online suggestions, reflections, general considerations for the next student covering the role. This step can have different levels of complexity, ranging from very simple – activating just one or two roles – to very complex when to each student is assigned a role.

*Sixth step*: toward a group product. During this step, learning groups should be active. The aim is to combine both the knowledge acquired through the material individually studied and the various answers to the research question that students reported in their reviews. A new web-forum can be devoted to this step. We recommend finalizing this step toward the construction of a group shared object, that could be a map, a report, a poster, or a text. The teacher should be able to propose the right type of “object”, according to the age and competences of the students.

*Seventh step*: a module product. At the end of each module, groups are required to work all together to produce a collective object. Again, is up to the teacher to propose the right object. For instance, if during the previous step groups produced a map, now the teacher can propose to build a single, inclusive map, amalgamating the previous maps and including all the concepts studied during the modules. Alternatively, it can be proposed the construction of a questionnaire to interview an expert of the field of the course; or it can be an observational tool to analyze products relevant for the course. This step is aimed at avoiding the fragmentation that the modular organization may induce. Therefore, while working on a collective object, a twofold aim can be pursued: (a) students have the occasion to gain the global vision of the course; (b) they can go back to specific concepts not fully grasped during the module activities.

**Student evaluation**

Because of the complexity of the activities, we developed a protocol able to take into account group and individual activities. Some activities have been assessed by the teacher; some by the e-Tutors and some by both of them. For example, the content of the map was assessed by the teacher whilst the e-Tutors assessed the contribution each student offer to its construction. As soon as an activity is completed, a score is assigned by using a Likert Scale (1: not good at all; 5: excellent).

At the end of each module, the filled assessment greed was uploaded on the platform, so students received a timely feedback and their capability of self-assessment could be modeled.

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

-   For students it was not so easy to think in terms of a professional product. This needs to be carefully scaffold.

-   In some groups, some tension influenced the performance. I solved this problem by re-organizing those groups.

-   <span id="_fsckpayoruy5" class="anchor"></span>E-portfolios and reflexive activities are often under-estimated by students. A great scaffold is needed also for these activities.

-   Finally, students are not so technological advanced as one may think. A familiarization and an individual scaffold is some time needed. I used the e-tutors for this matter.

-   Overall, the course went very well: students were excited and could really feel a real improvement in terms of technical and communication skills and about their general understanding of the many potentialities e-learning offers.
