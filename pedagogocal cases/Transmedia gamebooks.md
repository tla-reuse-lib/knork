**Pedagogical case: Transmedia: gamebooks (Italian, Computer Science, History and Law, Vocational School)**

**Author(s):** Paolo Nappo, Vincenza Cupertino

**Affiliation(s)**: ???

**Date of publication**: June 14, 2015

**The educational problem**

According to the Board of Education guidelines regarding the new reorganization of schools, whoever achieves a specialized diploma in Graphic Design and Communication must be competent in interpersonal and mass communication and have know-how as regards technology. Such competences are supported by a common cultural area which offers further insight on the complexity of society, implementing technical and critical knowledge as well as a willingness towards change, indispensable for our present times.

The class which is taking part in this project is a second-year one, made up of 27 students of the Technical and Technological Institute for Graphic Design and Communication. Their starting levels are diverse and some students also have complicated personal backgrounds which all too often disturb the learning process.

The following situations, supported by documentation, can be highlighted:

-   1 student with diverse abilities who follows a differentiated school programme

-   2 students who attended a different school the previous year

-   1 student who is in a correctional penitentiary

-   1 student with specific learning disabilities (dyscalculia)

-   1 student with severe reduced mobility difficulties which complicate the socialization process

**The solution**

The class which has been selected to experiment with this new project is a first year class of a Secondary Technical and Technological School specializing in Graphic Design and Communication. It is a new study-orientation which is present for the first time in our school and foresees a more creative learning approach as it is supported by a technological, scientific and computerized dimension which is part of its specific syllabus.

The choice for the project and for creating a videogame is a consequence of the necessity to experiment with new learning ways and to experiment with the use of ICT, in order to make didactics closer to the learning schemes of our students by means of a plurality of languages, which are those used when putting a videogame together: electronic culture, cinema, animation, literature, painting, cartoons, etc.

The aim is to stimulate collaboration among students through team work, making some situations less dramatic and making students more receptive and participative also during traditional lessons; to stimulate specific logical and creative abilities through discussion (by imagining hypothetical situations and immersing oneself in new problems trying to find a solution to such problems); to create new ways of self-evaluation and shared evaluation; to balance the knowledge of mathematical languages and algorithmic ones, as foreseen by the Italian Board of education guidelines.

**Key experiences**

We have often asked ourselves “How useful is what we are doing?”. From a didactic point of view it has been very useful as it has pushed us teachers towards a synchronized way of working, planning, modifying and verifying.

As for the students, it has also been useful as it has allowed them to learn in a different way using both old and new literary books, they have been challenged by Scratch, a new programming language, used for the creation of interactive stories, games and animations that could be shared on the web. It has been also useful for web surfers who can come across the game The legend of NOVECENTO and find it fun.

**Materials and links**

Is it possible to have a title in each link in English so that readers can understand what the links are about? It is also better to put the titles in the website and embed the links into the titles.

**Detailed description of the pedagogical implementation**

**Background information**

Educational level: First year class of a Secondary Technical and Technological School specializing in Graphic Design and Communication

Topic:

Subject domain(s): Italian, Computer Science, History and Law

Duration: ???

**Learning goals**

Most certainly the integration between a technical subject like Computer Science and a literary one. In order to create the game, the students who are highly enthusiastic native digital users, had to look into the novel considering its multimedia aspects and, consequently, the aim has always been that to have them understand that a formal model of language can generate other models, through which the native digital user is not a mere, passive user but a creator of products that arise from their own creativity.

The subjects that will be part of the project are:

-   Italian: analysis of a literary text

-   Computer Science: using the formal language of Algorithm

-   History and Law: transversely, for the promotion of advanced processes of knowledge as regards the migratory phenomenon

**Preparations before the course**

Describe issues to be taken care of and tasks to be done before the course starts.

**ICT tool(s)**

Padlet, Google Drive, Scratch

**Schedule and working phases**

Structure of the working process (preferably a picture or graph)

What are the main phases of the working process during the course in chronological order?

What are the tasks and activities in each phase and how they are organized?

Perhaps some of the descriptions in the DP table could be moved here?

Didactical and motivational successes

1.  Listening to the audiobook by Alessandro Baricco “Novecento” read by Stefano Benni

2.  Rewriting of “Novecento” by Alessandro Baricco

3.  Algorithms and flowcharts, the *Scratch* platform

4.  Scene-writing of the play

5.  Graphical representations of the various scenes with the *Scratch* platform. Promoting the activity by elaborating new audio registrations, new demos for the videos, revision of some of the parts of the scenery, improvement of the graphic aspects, elaboration of logos (both for class and project), selection of musical tracks, graphical elaboration of a brochure, collective storytelling in order to narrate what has happened.

6.  Italian and Computer Science summative evaluation - throughout the various phases of work, the task carried out by students were evaluated individually and collectively for both of the subjects involved.

**Student evaluation**

While students were at work, an evaluation grid was put together in order to evaluate both individual and group participation. The evaluation grid highlighted two parameters (the group and the individual) according to the various work phases.

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

Without realizing it, although quite young, the students started applying Latin grammar rules which are completely based on logical conjunctions such as *et*, *vel* and negations ( *and*, *or* and *not* in English). Moving a character (puppet) under false or true conditions is not an easy thing to understand nevertheless they started doing in by intuition.

It is important to understand that native digital users are as they are because they were born that way so they communicate through their mobile phones, everyone else is an analphabet digital user.

"Don't just play with your phones, program them!"
