**The educational problem**

In traditional educational process with face to face teaching, individual student’s tasks and teacher’s guidance for individual students, when needed, student cannot obtain necessary competencies. The educational challenge was to meet the requirements of business to future employees for:

-   Abilities to work in group;

-   Networking;

-   Working on multidisciplinary tasks, utilizing multiple knowledge sources;

-   Better practical training (experience in using software and CAD tools);

-   Abilities to resolve complex problems;

-   Abilities to use rich computer technologies and environments.

The problem was how to restructure the VLSI Design course in order to:

-   Increase students motivation providing them with practically oriented projects;

-   Increase students’ knowledge and competencies,

-   Increase students’ abilities to work collaboratively with individual responsibility to quality of common product.

**The solution**

To resolve upper mentioned problems we use trialogical approach to learning with using cloud collaborative environment, monitoring of group work and individual contribution to every team member. The problem is how to re-design our courses to better promote students’ knowledge work competencies and how to implement the trialogical design principles in own teaching.

Instead of giving students many separate or loosely connected tasks we provide them with a large task (a three month long project), continuous working process, shared research plan and final presentation in groups. All group activities are organized around shared objects – collaboratively development of common project, and preparation of shared report.

**Key experiences**

Project development in such practice permits for self-selected time and place allocation of the participants and teachers. Guidance is provided through systematic instructions and group work rules. This approach permits for educational methods of direct student-educator contact that are not face-to-face, but are mediated through new communications technologies.

Online communication allows students and academics to remain separated by space and time, but to sustain an ongoing dialogue. The immediacy of the help provided via email, compared to the scheduled face to face meeting, was cited as a major plus in the post-course surveys. Students were doing most of the development during the weekends and evenings (some of them are already part-time working in the companies). Being able to receive a timely advice on their design problems was highly regarded. The students were more motivated and challenged to work on relatively complex projects by using up-to-date tools and environments which they see in use in the companies.

**Materials and links**

Students are provided all materials for lectures, guidance for exercises, instructions for handling simulation tools, project template, tutorials, supporting materials and libraries.

**Implementing the trialogical design principles**

**DP1: Organising activities around shared objects**

Collaboratively development of three months long common project, preparation of shared report.

Activities: face to face meeting for distribution project tasks, defining and preliminary review of the tools used; getting students acquainted with the phases of design cycle.

Teams organization – creating Google accounts, giving students ability to choose team partner and form the team according their interest and previous experience.

Task distribution between the teams, offering lists of possible projects themes. Students have also an opportunity to offer theme of their interest (based on working tasks in the company, future diploma project etc.). These need to be approved by the teacher if are relevant.

**DP2: Supporting integration of personal and collective agency and work**

Coordinate participants’ interest – team members to choose an appropriate project they want to develop and are interested in.

Motivate students to manage tasks distribution between team members having respect to deadline by giving students’ responsibility to be team leader in turn. There are two strictly defined deadlines during the project cycle and performing task within given deadlines is one of the criteria for project evaluation.

Combining participants' own interests and shared project through assessment process – the quality of the shared project and the responsibilities to deadlines are evaluated with better grade.

**DP3: Emphasizing development and creativity through knowledge transformations and reflection**

Support versatile use of various kinds of knowledge: theoretical or literary sources; practical examples and cases; pictures, videos, models. Discus problems student faced during collective work on the shared object.

Reflect on collective practices and knowledge.

Make students comment on each other’s work through the semester.

Encourage students independently and creatively initiate, lead and manage a development process.

Require student to apply already obtained knowledge and skills in using CAD tools to resolve complex practical tasks.

**DP4: Fostering long-term processes of knowledge advancement **

Continuous working process, iterative design process to improve circuit performance and parameters in order to fulfill technical specifications.

Building on previous achievements from bachelor degree courses.

Planning and start writing the documents, sharing the drafts, getting feedback from the teacher and other students, improving the project and project report, submitting relevant documents.

Using forums and blogs for discussing problems and exchanging views and opinions.

The best final team projects and their shared reports are used during the course as good examples for other teams, as well as after the course by the students themselves or by others.

**DP5: Promoting cross-fertilization of knowledge practices and artifacts across communities**

Students use professional tools for projects development. They are provided with professional work models and design flow cycle used in industry.

Expert practices are modeled for students, via templates and tools.

Students and teachers collaborate on solving a shared problem.

Students use up-to-date cloud computing and communication tools for planning, organizing and writing shared reports.

**DP6: Providing flexible tools for developing artifacts and practices**

Google Drive, Docs, Sheets for collaborative editing of the project reports, reviewing and commenting.

Google calendar – to set deadlines and to monitor progress – assignments, intermediate stages reporting, deadline for submission of project.

For inter team communications students can choose their preferred tools (chat, conferences, e-mail, forums).

For student – teacher communications are used Google applications: Gmail, Calendar, Drive and Google+.

**Detailed description of the pedagogical implementation**

**Background information**

Educational level: Bachelor degree (3<sup>rd</sup> semester)

Topic: Semiconductor devices (compulsory course)

Subject domain(s): Electronics

Duration: 15 weeks

**Learning goals**

The course covers design hierarchy, structured design methodology, simulation, and layout strategies of digital VLSI circuits using a comprehensive set of CAD tools. Synthesis of complex CMOS gates, CMOS alternatives, delays, load capacitances, layout and design verification are considered. Topics includes MOS device models including deep sub-micron effects; circuit design styles for logic, arithmetic and sequential blocks; estimation and minimization of energy consumption; interconnect models and parasitics; device sizing; timing issues (clock skew) and active clock distribution techniques. The course employs extensive use of circuit layout and SPICE in design projects and software labs.

At the end of the course the students are expected to:

-   Know the design methodology, design flow and specific design automation tools used at different levels of the design hierarchy;

-   Have ability to design basic logic blocks of custom integrated circuit and evaluate their parameters.

-   Obtain skills in using professional engineering CAD tools for circuit analysis and tools for layout design, ERC, DRC and LVS verification.

-   Expand experience in team working on a common project using tools for collaboration, planning and communication.

**Preparations before the course**

Before the course starts the following issues needs to be done:

-   Teams’ formation

-   Gmail accounts of all students

-   Development of documentation template for final report

-   Guidelines for students for practical sessions

-   Tutorials for used CAD tools

-   Defining of project themes

-   Explication pedagogical aims and methods

-   Negotiation project assignment

**ICT tool(s)**

**Tools that support co-construction of shared artifacts**

LTspice<sup>®</sup> – Circuit Simulation, Schematic Capture and Waveform Viewer Tool

Gnu Electric – Layout design and layout verification tool

**Tools that support integrated organization of collaboration and coordination**

Google Tools are used for collaborative development of a common shared object in the cloud – Google Drive, Docs, Sheets; *Google calendar* – to set deadlines and to monitor progress – assignments, intermediate stages reporting, deadline for submission of project.

For inter team communications students can choose their preferred tools (chat, conferences, e-mail, forums). For student – teacher communications are used Google applications: Gmail, Calendar, Drive and Google+.

**Schedule and working phases**

Project based learning approach is used. The goal is student to learn core curriculum as they work on the 3 months long project, to go through all stages of the design cycle, and to acquire skills in teamwork and creating common shared documents. Students work in groups of 3-4 persons on a shared common project and report, which is continuously monitored, taking into account the individual contribution of each team member.

**Project initiation** phase includes activities as follow:

-   Arrange project organization and management

-   Establish timeframes, intermediate and final deadlines

-   Link project phases to professional practices

-   Facilitate tool and environment reception

-   Promote collective responsibility and identity

-   Define rules and criteria for group work

**Project execution** involves activities as:

-   Setting up assignments that require iterations of contributions

-   Providing guidance and facilitation to support advancement

-   Guiding dynamic changes in planned ways of working

-   Supporting dealing with complexity

-   Providing model for expected outcomes

From the students perspective according the professional practices the main phases of the working process during the project execution include:

-   Specification

-   Architecture

-   Circuit design

-   Circuit analysis with simulation

-   Layout design

-   Design verification for ERC, DRC and LVS

-   Finalization of shared report

In *specification* students need to describe the purpose and technical parameters of the device. In the *architecture* phase students should design structural diagram of the device, brief description of the blocks and the links between them, as well as algorithms of functioning. Detailed description of the different blocks is needed - what is the purpose of this block, *Circuit design* - schematic, results of simulation, layout, and results of re-simulation. *Simulation* of the entire device includes description of the test unit, timing diagrams and their explanation. *Layout and re-simulation* of the entire device considers activities as layout design, timing diagrams and assessment of the chip area. In the final shared report students have to explain circuit functionality, result of simulations, and screen shot of layout design and verification. Explanations on faced difficulties and suggestions for improvements are encouraged.

**Project presentation** and evaluation includes

-   Providing feedback on process and outcomes

-   Collecting feedback

-   Encouraging exploitation of project outcomes

**Student evaluation**

The assessment is based on collaborative project result, and individual homework (80%) and final exam test (20%). Clear evaluation criteria were stated before starting project development. Project complexity, professional skills, (teacher responsibility), quality of written materials (peers review), quality of presentation (public defense) and deadline respect are most important. Final test is used for checking students’ ability to apply basic theoretical knowledge.

**Experiences and suggestions for improvements**

What worked well?

-   Greater interest and involvement of the majority of students;

-   In addition to the core subject matter, students had to learn new tools and development workflows as well as collaborative cloud tools;

-   Students appreciate teamwork and development of common project instead of regular classes;

-   The immediacy of the help provided via email, compared to the scheduled face to face meeting, was cited as a major plus in the post-course surveys;

-   Ability to work in convenient for them time and place are appreciated, because give them ability to practice in the companies. Being able to receive a timely advice on their design problems was highly regarded.

What did not work so well?

-   The introduction of relatively complex, “real world” design workflows and tools highlighted even more the difference between the motivated teams and the students that just wanted to “get over it”. This observation was confirmed by the scores distribution – most were clustered in the top and bottom of the scale with very few in between.

-   Difficulties in precise evaluation of personal contribution of each team member to common work

-   Problems how to force not motivated students to contribute to common work

How would you improve the solution?

-   To define criteria for evaluation of responsibilities in teams, according to the complexity of the project.

-   To stimulate not enough active students to participate will make students to comment on each other’s or other groups’ work and the teachers will give bonuses in final mark for provided peer review.
