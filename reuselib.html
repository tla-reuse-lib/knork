Re-use Library is a web repository including re-usable examples and material supporting teachers in the implementation of collaborative knowledge creation practices and supporting technologies in educational settings. Material is constructed from the experiences and research results of the pedagogical case studies conducted in the KNORK project.

Re-use Library includes, so far, four types of items:

    Pedagogical cases: examples of pedagogical scenarios and course designs from secondary and tertiary level education;
    
    Tool suggestions: examples and suggestions about various instruments and digital tools to be used with students, and
    
    Educational design patterns: suggestions about repeatable solutions to individual educational design problems when implementing collaborative knowledge creation practices in education.
    
    Educational resource: suggestions about various types of materials that can be used for educational purposes.
